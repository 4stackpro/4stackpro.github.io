<p>Braith Anasta believes NRL teams will terrorise Quade Cooper in defence if he is given a short-term deal for the rest of this season.</p>
<p>However Sam Burgess and Gorden Tallis would like to see Cooper have a crack at making the switch even though they conceded the defensive requirements would be immense.</p>

<p>Quade would be terrorised 4:28</p>
<p>“Quade is an exceptionally talented player and he has skills that most people dream of and it would be exciting to watch, but would it work?” Anasta questioned on Fox League Live.</p>
<p>“Quade reminds me a little bit of the style of Benji Marshall.</p>
<p>“I played rugby union until I was 16 or 17 and it is a lot different defensively in the halves.</p>
<p>“This late in his career to move into the halves position he would be terrorised, just terrorised by back-rowers.</p>
<p>“Having to make repeat tackles and get back up. Is he as effective in attack with those players running at his inside shoulder?”</p>
<p>Burgess also admitted that he would target Cooper in defence, but commended the former Wallaby for having the guts to put his hand up.</p>

<p>“Give him a shot, I would love to see him have a go,” Burgess said</p>
<p>“I would love to see it because he would get terrorised. If I was playing I would terrorise him and test him out. There is a bit of the cross code and I’ve done it.</p>
<p>“The transition is hard and there is not as many transferable skills as you’d imagine.</p>
<p>“The ball is the same shape, the field is the same, but the games are completely different.</p>
<p>“It’s chess and checkers and it would be hard for Quade to come and get a handle on the defensive system.</p>

<p>“Angus Crichton came from rugby to Souths as a kid and it took him three or four years to get the grip of the defensive system.</p>
<p>“I’d love to see him give it a go and it is pretty brave of him to come out and say it so someone give him a shot.”</p>
<p>Tallis suggested fullback might be a better option for Cooper than the halves because of the defensive demands of halfbacks and five-eighths in modern rugby league.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t terrorise him, but I would run at him a lot, but that is what you do these days,” Tallis said.</p>
<p>Masoe&rsquo;s inspiring journey 0:51</p>
<p>“I’d be so keen to watch Quade come into our game. I think he can attack brilliantly.</p>
<p>“When the Queensland Reds won the Super Rugby title Quade was a big part of that. He’s played on every big stage that rugby can offer.</p>
<p>“But rugby league is a totally different kettle of fish. I would love to see him come over and try his hand.</p>
<p>“I think fullback maybe to give him a little bit more space. In rugby league you attack off the front foot where as in union it is off the back foot, which would maybe help his game.</p>
<p>“But it is defence. You can’t hide, it is a jungle out there and they will find your weakness.”

<h3 id="quade-cooper-video-pass-nfl-rugby-tevita-pangai-jr">Quade Cooper, video, pass, NFL, rugby, Tevita Pangai Jr</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6fdf04150efdd363990c309761a52722" alt="img">
Quade Cooper has done it again. First the former Wallaby showed off his behind-the-back rugby passing with an incredible video last week, which went viral and inspired St Kilda star Brad Hill to attempt the feat.</p>
<p>Now Cooper has taken things to the next level with a stunningly acrobatic new trick. In it, he swaps the rugby ball for an American football, contorting himself into a pretzel to launch a pinpoint 20 metre pass.</p>
<p>The ball flew straight to the chest of Brisbane Broncos talent Tevita Pangai Jnr; the pair have been training together at Brisbane’s Red Hill.</p>

<p>Cooper’s ridiculous new pass is again going viral, with fans around the world comparing his passing accuracy to millionaire NFL starters – and marvelling at how he didn’t manage to injure himself in the process.</p>
<p>SportsCenter from the US shared the magical pass on Twitter, sending US fans bonkers.

Quade Cooper responds to fans criticising his skills in stunning new video</p>
<p>Quade Cooper responds to fans who have been criticising his skills in a stunning new video which is going viral online.</p>
<p>Last week Quade Cooper posted an incredible behind the back pass which has been going viral online, garnering well over 3 million views on all platforms.</p>
<p>The video originally showed an incredible pass that Quade Cooper did to one of his teammates in a training session.</p>
<p>The response to it originally was positive, but some rugby fans online have taken it as an opportunity to take an unneeded pop at the Australian fly-half.</p>
<p>Some fans online said that it is all well and good being skilful in training, but it’s the matches that truly matter.</p>
<p>Users online have called him things such as a ‘drama queen’ and high maintenance for his relationships with rugby clubs in the past like the Reds and the Melbourne Rebels.</p>
<p>Quade Coopers “skilful” passes won’t undo his mediocre career! 😂 — springbokbabyyy (@springbokbabyyy) April 10, 2020</p>
<p>Cooper thought it would be worthwhile to send a response to his haters this morning, by posting a piece of skill that is even more incredible than the one before.</p>
<p>In this video, Cooper was holding an NFL ball rather than a rugby ball, but the accuracy was certainly still there.</p>
<p>If there is one way to respond to your haters, then this is it.</p>
<p>The talismanic fly-half always seems to respond in the best ways to contraversy by handling his haters in the right way.</p>
<p>Quade is currently plying his trade in Japan for Kintetsu Liners. The Australian has put in some fantastic performances for the teams there, playing at a level which he is in all honesty too good for.</p>
<p>He plays alongside teammate and long-time friend Will Genia who he played with at 9 and 10 for the reds.</p>
<p>He played semi pro for a while for Brisbane City.</p>
<p>He humiliated everyone!</p>
<p>W certainly have a soft spot here for Quade Cooper who will always be remembered as one of the most exciting players in rugby!
