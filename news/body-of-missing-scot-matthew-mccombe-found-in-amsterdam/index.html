<h3 id="body-of-missing-scottish-man-21-found-in-duivendrecht">Body of missing Scottish man, 21, found in Duivendrecht</h3>
<p><img src="https://nltimes.nl/sites/nl-times.nl/files/styles/fb_main/public/2020/03/img-5766.jpg" alt="img">
A pedestrian walking in Duivendrecht Wednesday morning found the body of 21-year-old Matthew McCombe. The Scottish man had been missing since March 14, after he left his hotel early that morning.</p>
<p>Police would not speculate on foul play, saying only that his cause of death was under investigation, police told NL Times. His body was found at about 9:10 a.m. in the water at the Molenkade, part of a wide area where volunteers and rescue workers had focused their efforts in the two weeks after he disappeared.</p>
<p>McCombe was staying at the Novotel in Amsterdam Zuid for the weekend, celebrating his birthday with some friends. He walked out of the hotel towards the RAI convention center at 6:15 a.m., and a half-hour later he was walking on Amsteldijk near the Berlagebrug, a bridge over the Amstel river, surveillance camera footage showed.</p>
<p>McCombe&rsquo;s father had been in town to try and track down his son&rsquo;s whereabouts. The social distancing measures in place to fight the spread of coronavirus made it difficult to coordinate a large volunteer search effort, a family representative said.</p>
<p>He was identified by the Scottish Sun newspaper as being the grandson of football legend Billy McNeill, who captained Celtic when the team won its 1967 European Cup.</p>
<p>Anyone who might have seen McCombe after his disappearance should contact police so they can piece together the events that led up to Wednesday morning&rsquo;s discovery.

<p>The family of a young Scottish man who disappeared while celebrating his 21st birthday in Amsterdam have made an appeal for information on Dutch TV.</p>
<p>Matthew McCombe, the grandson of Celtic legend Billy McNeill, has not been seen since Saturday 14 March.</p>
<p>He left the Novotel in Europaboulevard at 06:15 and has not been in touch since.</p>
<p>His father Charlie McCombe and mother Paula urged anyone who may have seen him to get in touch.</p>
<p>Celtic FC and many of its former players and supporters have also shared appeals.</p>
<p>Image copyright Facebook / Paula McCombe Image caption Parents Paula and Charlie McCombe appeared on Dutch TV to make an appeal</p>
<p>Mr McCombe, from Glasgow, said: &ldquo;For some reason, we don&rsquo;t know why, he left the hotel room at 06:15.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a text at 01:36. I&rsquo;d asked him earlier asking how was it and he texted back saying, &ldquo;class night&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happened. We just ask the people if they can jog their memories back to that Saturday - and if they have seen him, let us know, so we can find out where he might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if anybody has Matthew, please give him back to his mum and dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matthew left without his phone, wallet or passport and has not made contact with anyone since.</p>
<p>His cousins have kept a presence on social media asking people to share photos and appeals with contacts in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Mr and Mrs McCombe have travelled there, but the spread of coronavirus and social distancing have hampered efforts to trace him.</p>
<p>A CCTV video shows his last sighting at 08:15 the same morning, running east across Berlagebrug bridge towards Amstel railway station.</p>
<p>He was wearing black jogging bottoms and a pale blue Stone Island jumper.</p>
<p>Matthew&rsquo;s mother Paula, daughter of Lisbon Lion Billy McNeill who died last year aged 79, has asked the &ldquo;Celtic family&rdquo; to help on her Facebook page.</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m reaching out to you, the Celtic family, begging for your help to find my son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been missing in Amsterdam for over two weeks now and we are desperate to find him and bring him home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our hearts are broken.&rdquo;
