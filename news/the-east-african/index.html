<p>Sixteen more people have tested positive for the coronavirus, raising Kenya&rsquo;s total number of cases to 336.</p>
<p>Dr Rashid Aman, Health Chief Administrative Secretary, told a press conference on Friday that the new patients were among 946 tested in 12 counties in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>He said surveillance teams picked up 11 of the cases in Nairobi County and five in Mombasa County.</p>
<p>In Nairobi, five cases were recorded in Dandora estate, two each in City Park and Parklands estates and one each in Eastleigh and Pipeline.</p>
<p>In Mombasa, Kiembeni, Centi Kumi, Stadium, Msikiti Nuru and Mulaloni estates reported one case each.</p>
<p>Dr Aman reported that since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in Kenya on March 13, a total of 16,738 tests had been conducted.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>He said five more patients had recovered, raising the total number to 94, and that the number of deaths had remained 14 since April 18.</p>
<p>He said 887 contacts were being monitored.</p>
<p>RESTRICTIONS</p>
<p>Dr Aman noted that the 21-day curfew that President Uhuru Kenyatta imposed nationwide was nearing its end.</p>
<p>He said significant gains had been made since it was effected on March 27 but regretted that there had been a return to mass gatherings in some areas.</p>
<p>Regarding the push for the full reopening of the courts, he said this is not the time and that lawyers to considered the grave danger the country is facing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thank the Judiciary, through Chief Justice David Maraga, for exercising restraint in handling this matter,&rdquo; Dr Aman said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The health and safety of our court users comes first, otherwise there be no one to dispense justice to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Earlier, the Judiciary issued a statement denying reports that it had allowed church services to take place with restrictions in place.</p>
<p>It noted that a prayer by pastors Don Mutugi, Joan Miriti and Alex Gichunge, in a petition filed at the High Court&rsquo;s Constitutional and Huma Rights Division, was not granted.</p>
<p>The Judiciary said it had only permitted alternative forms of worship such as broadcasting services online.</p>
<p>STATISTICS</p>
<p>The coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, China, on December 31, 2019.</p>
<p>Since then, it has quickly spread across the world and infected at least 2,744,614 people, according to Worldometer&rsquo;s tally on April 24.</p>
<p>The total number of deaths was 191,791 and that of recoveries 755,443 as of April 24, while the number of active cases stood at 1,797,380, with three per cent or 58,693 of them being critical and the rest mild.</p>
<p>Worldometer&rsquo;s count showed that the number of closed cases was 947,234, with 80 per cent or 755,443 being the number of recoveries or those discharged.

State open to trials of new virus vaccine</p>
<p>The government is open to a plan by United Kingdom-based scientists to try out a Covid-19 vaccine in the country. Health Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman yesterday said although a formal request had not been made to the government by the scientists at Oxford University, once made, it would be considered. An article published by the BBC on Thursday indicated that the UK was considering testing the vaccine in Kenya.</p>

<p>“If this request comes to us, it will be scrutinised by the government before we respond to it,” said Dr Aman. The CAS said even with the expression of interest by the scientists, Kenya had detailed guidelines for such an activity to be carried out in the country. “There are laid down procedures, which are rigorous for approval of any trial,” he said.</p>

<p>He added: “We have a robust structure at Pharmacy and Poisons Board for regulating any clinical trial.” The clinical trials of the said vaccine, which is said to have the ability to boost one’s immunity with just one dose, started in the UK on Thursday.</p>

<p>Some 800 people are targeted. The vaccine is the latest strand of hope against Covid-19 after both Remdisivir and Hydroxychloroquine drugs failed clinical trials as potential treatment to the disease. The vaccine is made from a weakened version of common cold virus, extracted from chimpanzees, and modified so that it does not replicate in humans. However, it is not clear how soon the vaccine or a report on its efficacy will be ready since the scientists have to wait and see if any of the 800 volunteers will be infected.</p>

<p>Only half of the 800 will be injected with the vaccine while the other half will be a control group who to be immunised against meningitis. The interest of the scientists in Kenya, as reported by the BBC, has been informed by the low number of infections in the country, which currently stands at two per cent. This means only two of 100 people tested turn positive. As of yesterday, the number of coronavirus cases in Kenya had hit 336 after 16 more people tested positive. The 16 were from 946 samples collected across 12 counties.</p>

<p>Of the 16, 11 are from Nairobi and five from Mombasa. Some 887 contacts are still on follow-up, with the number of recoveries rising to 94 after five more patients tested negative. Death toll from the virus is still 14.</p>

<h3 id="mass-coronavirus-testing-to-uncover-how-far-disease-has-spread--kenya-news-agency">Mass coronavirus testing to uncover how far disease has spread – Kenya News Agency</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.kenyanews.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/android-chrome-256x256-150x150.png" alt="img">
The government will scale up mass testing for coronavirus in the coming weeks to uncover how far the disease has spread in the country.</p>
<p>The Health Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS), Dr. Rashid Aman said the government would first concentrate on counties with high number of covid-19 cases.</p>
<p>He defended the government move, saying there could be more cases in the country than ‘are known about’ and ‘mass testing is a sure way to calculate true spread of coronavirus’.</p>
<p>Dr. Aman said the government was determined to press ahead with mass testing since it was a sure way to capture the true scale of the virus across the 47 counties.</p>
<p>He said with mass testing, patients who have no idea that they were even sick since they were asymptomatic (showing no symptoms) would be flagged out.</p>
<p>“Asymptomatic carriers play a big role in the spread of the pandemic far and wide and we need to stop that through mass testing,” he said.</p>
<p>He said findings from other countries hard hit by the pandemic indicated that many people were infected but had no symptoms of covid-19.</p>
<p>He spoke on Wednesday while on a fact finding mission at the Lunga Lunga border town in Kwale that straddles the Kenya-Tanzania border.</p>
<p>The CAS pointed out that they would prioritize government ministry employees and areas with high populations such as informal settlements in urban areas to create a full epidemiological picture of the outbreak.</p>
<p>Dr. Aman was accompanied by his counterparts in the ministries of Transport and Interior Chris Obure and Hussein Dado.</p>
<p>Obure said beyond giving the true number of infections, the mass testing would ascertain the exposure of various groups to the virus.</p>
<p>He said people over 60 years of age and those with previous medical conditions have a higher risk of being infected by the virus and should adhere to the stay-at-home orders.</p>
<p>“The mass testing will also target high risk population such as healthcare workers and older people who are susceptible to infections,” he said.</p>
<p>Covid-19 symptoms include fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, repeated shaking with chills and sore throat.</p>
