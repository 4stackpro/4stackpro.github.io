Now that the coronavirus outbreak is wreaking havoc across the world, the pandemic movie Contagion is circling back into relevance. Contagion portrays a virus that is very similar to coronavirus in many ways. A doctor recently rewatched the movie, and noted how life in 2020 seems to be reflecting 2011’s art. However, he–terrifyingly–believes COVID-19 is a more dangerous virus than the fictional disease from Contagion.</p>
<p>Doctor argues coronavirus is ‘worse’ than infectious disease in 2011 movie ‘Contagion’</p>

<p>Paul Carson is a doctor from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He wrote an editorial for TribeLIVE.com last month. For the article, Dr. Carson “rewatched Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 film Contagion,” and in light of the coronavirus pandemic, he called the movie “a cautionary tale.”</p>
<p>The MD pointed out several things in common between the fictional disease in Contagion and coronavirus. Both viruses are “highly contagious, transmitted easily through surface contact,” Dr. Carson wrote. This happens via public transportation, especially in urban centers. Also, each disease uses “common respiratory droplet transmission.”</p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<p>They determined the virus to have a very high R0 value, which is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. All of this so far is very consistent with what we know about covid-19.</p>
<p>COVID-19 is more dangerous in its differences from the film’s virus</p>
<p>However, Dr. Carson also brought up many features of the COVID-19 outbreak that make it distinct from the Contagion virus. For instance, the movie disease had a higher mortality rate. This appears to make coronavirus less dangerous at first. But Dr. Carson explained in his opinion piece how it’s actually the opposite. He wrote:</p>
<p>…in the film, the fictional virus had a very high fatality rate. This made for great onscreen gore, excitement and drama — but diverges from what we believe about covid-19. While this may sound good, it is in fact not.</p>
<p>He used actress Gwyneth Paltrow’s character as an example. Dr. Carson recalled of Contagion: “Paltrow was dead by the first 10 minutes of the film.” This helped halt the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>“By dying, she stopped her own transmission of the virus to others,” the doctor explained. “The host died, the virus died with that transmission.”</p>

<p>Like Ebola, Dr. Carson went on to describe: “the high death rate helped contain the virus.”</p>
<p>“While I am not wishing death on anyone, it’s actually a built-in containment mechanism,” he wrote.</p>
<p>That means that coronavirus is much more easily spread–because it’s less deadly.</p>
<p>“With covid-19 infection, most will walk around for near a week without feeling any symptoms, unknowingly spreading the virus,” Dr. Carson shared. He continued:</p>
<p>When we do finally feel sick, if you are lucky enough to get a test, then and only then are you asked to ‘quarantine.’ By then, if you were not already sheltering in place prior to the testing, you probably spread it to a whole bunch of people.</p>
<p>Doctor urges readers to spread the information during the pandemic</p>

<p>The physician said he hoped his piece would be “shared with the people who are not taking this seriously.” Dr. Carson urged his readers: “Be smart. Be safe. Share.”</p>
<p>“What you do now will affect the world, your country, your family and loved ones,” the doctor warned.

<h3 id="contagion-vs-coronavirus-the-films-connections-to-a-real-life-pandemic">&lsquo;Contagion&rsquo; vs. coronavirus: The film&rsquo;s connections to a real life pandemic</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200326161717-01-contagion-restricted-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) As we live through a developing pandemic , some of us can&rsquo;t help but compare it to the 2011 American thriller which some claim predicted Covid-19: &ldquo;Contagion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Directed by Steven Soderbergh and written by Scott Z. Burns, the film follows the spread of a virus transmitted when sick humans touch surfaces and leave virus behind that others can catch. Next comes the frantic attempts by public health officials to identify and contain the disease, the anarchy that unfolds amid a pandemic, and the ultimate introduction of a vaccine to stop the spread. Sound like a plot we&rsquo;re in the middle of?</p>
<p>Its prescience was bolstered by Burns consulting with representatives of the World Health Organization on the ins and outs of infectious diseases, and by Kate Winslet working with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to understand the lifestyle and character of an epidemiologist charged with leading the world through crisis.</p>
<p>The filmmakers also consulted medical experts including Dr. W. Ian Lipkin and Lawrence &ldquo;Larry&rdquo; Brilliant. Lipkin is the director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University Mailman School of Health. He recently contracted the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Laurie Garrett also served as a consultant on the film because she wrotethe 1994 book &ldquo;The Coming Plague&rdquo; and reported on multiple pandemics. In a 2001 article she wrote for CNN , Garrett described &ldquo;Contagion&quot;as &ldquo;part fantasy, part reality and totally possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is how the virus and drama of &ldquo;Contagion&rdquo; compares with the real life coronavirus pandemic as it currently stands.</p>
<p>Virus origins</p>
<p>The final scene in &ldquo;Contagion&rdquo; reveals that the fictional &ldquo;MEV-1&rdquo; virus originated from a pig that ate a piece of banana dropped by an infected bat escaping the destruction of its palm tree forest habitat in China.</p>
<p>That pig is then slaughtered and prepared by a chef who, without washing them first, shakes hands with Beth Emhoff (played by Gwyneth Paltrow), thus transmitting the virus to her. Emhoff becomes the &ldquo;index case,&rdquo; meaning she was the first identified case.</p>
<p>Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) is considered the index case in &ldquo;Contagion,&rdquo; here seen transmitting the virus to another patient.</p>
<p>The origin of the novel coronavirus terrorizing us today is still a mystery to scientists. It will only be solved if they&rsquo;re able to isolate the live virus in a suspected species (like in the movie), which can be difficult.</p>
<p>to be the possible source of the coronavirus. However, like &ldquo;Contagion,&rdquo; bats are considered by some epidemiologists to be the possible source of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Zoologists, ecologists and disease experts have told CNN that human behaviors &ndash; such as destroying natural habitats &ndash; might be to blame for the transfer of the disease.</p>
<p>When bats are stressed, which can occur from destruction of their habitats, their typically strong immune system is challenged, which makes it harder to cope with pathogens they could usually fight off. This allows an increase in infections and the shedding of them.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;wet markets,&rdquo; wild animals that also may be infected and stressed are held together and sold as food or pets, leading to a mix of viruses and species. One theory on the origin of the current coronavirus is that the initial epicenter was likely a &ldquo;wet market&rdquo; in Wuhan, China.In &ldquo;wet markets,&rdquo; wild animals that also may be infected and stressed are held together and sold as food or pets, leading to a mix of viruses and species.</p>
<p>Any &ldquo;zoonotic spillover,&rdquo; or the transfer of disease from animals to humans, is exacerbated by population density and public transport, which make it easy for a virus to spread rapidly.</p>
<p>Scientists studying the spread of the coronavirus have provided another theory: It may have spread into humans from animals in a less deadly form and circulated at low levels in humans for years before adapting to us and becoming seriously infectious, according to recent research published in the journal Nature Medicine.</p>
<p>If the &ldquo;Contagion&rdquo; bats were under stress from the palm tree destruction, the origin of the &ldquo;Contagion&rdquo; virus could mirror the potential origin of the current coronavirus.</p>
<p>Similar symptoms</p>
<p>Sick people in the film experienced fevers and profuse sweating, pounding headaches, sore throat and cough but also had seizures, dizziness and frothed at the mouth when they passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Contagion&rdquo;: A man in Hong Kong falls sick with MEV-1, the fictional virus.</p>
<p>Emergency warning signs of Covid-19 include &ldquo;persistent pain or pressure in the chest,&rdquo; &ldquo;bluish lips or face&rdquo; &ndash; indicating a lack of oxygen &ndash; and sudden mental confusion, fatigue or inability to rouse.</p>
<p>Less common symptoms of Covid-19 include those typically experienced during flu and cold: headaches, digestive issues, body aches and fatigue, and a runny nose, sore throat and sneezing.</p>
<p>Anosmia, a lack of sense of smell, and dygeusia, a lack of taste, are symptoms that might flag Covid-19 in its early stages among patients with a mild case.</p>
<p>Transmission</p>
<p>Like Covid-19, the film&rsquo;s MEV-1 is a respiratory disease, carried in expelled droplets of saliva from a sneeze or cough or other secretions. It spreads directly between people when those droplets reach the eyes, nose or mouth of an uninfected person.</p>
<p>The film&rsquo;s virus is also transmitted by fomites, or surfaces that have been contaminated with infections after sick humans touch them.</p>
<p>The spreading of MEV-1 is exacerbated by the average person touching their face a few thousand times per day &ndash; while in between, they&rsquo;re touching door handles, elevator buttons, subway poles and each other.</p>
<p>Evidence shows that the novel coronavirus transmits through the same mechanisms, according to the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Actors from &ldquo;Contagion&rdquo; recently urged people to &ldquo;control the contagion&rdquo; by washing their hands, practicing social distancing and following the advice of health experts In a series of PSAs from Columbia Public Health.</p>
<p>Can you be immune to the virus?</p>
<p>The fictional Mitch Emhoff (played by Matt Damon), husband of index case Beth, is found to be immune to the virus. He dodges the deliberately targeted coughs of strangers in grocery stores and survives through the film physically unscathed.</p>
<p>Today, there are no reports of people biologically immune to getting the novel coronavirus. But can one be immune to the novel coronavirus after recovering from it? Scientists aren&rsquo;t sure yet.</p>
<p>In the March 26 CNN Global Town Hall: Coronavirus Facts and Fears, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper asked physician Dr. Leana Wen whether a person can be immune to the virus via antibodies they developed after having and recovering from the disease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what we want to get to,&rdquo; she responded. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have that test yet. It&rsquo;s being developed. But that would be great. It would be so helpful for people to know whether they have immunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And if someone could be immune, we don&rsquo;t yet know how long it could last for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some people who speculate that one might have immunity for a long time, even forever, but we just don&rsquo;t know yet,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>The R0</p>
<p>The number of people a sick person is likely to infect is called the R0, or R-naught, of a virus. The R0 of the fictional MEV-1 virus was 4, while the R0 of coronavirus is 2.2, according to a recent study of data from the first cases of Covid-19 in Wuhan and investigations conducted by Chinese and American health officials.</p>
<p>They found the epidemic doubled about every seven days. In other words, on average, each Covid-19 patient transmits the infection to an additional 2.2 people.</p>
<p>The mortality rate</p>
<p>The mortality rate of the &ldquo;Contagion&rdquo; virus, or the percentage of those that die among an infected population, was estimated to be about 25% to 30%.</p>
<p>according to the As of March 26, the mortality rate among patients with Covid-19 is between 1.8% to 3.4%,according to the CDC</p>
<p>An unproven remedy: Forsythia vs. chloroquine</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Contagion,&rdquo; blogger Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) pushes forsythia, a floral homeopathic tincture, as the cure for the virus, although studies hadn&rsquo;t proved it worked.</p>
<p>He appeared to have recovered from the virus shortly after taking forsythia, and anxious customers clamored for prescriptions of the remedy from their local pharmacies as well as on Krumwiede&rsquo;s blog. He attracted more 12 million followers and several million dollars from the false claim, according to the film.</p>
<p>Law, in the production notes for the film , described his character as the &ldquo;&lsquo;index patient&rsquo; for what becomes a parallel epidemic of fear and panic&rdquo; based on mistrust of news media, the government and health officials.</p>
<p>Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) is a blogger who is skeptical of the government and news media and touts an unproven remedy for the virus.</p>
<p>There are currently no cures or vaccines for Covid-19, yet the drugs chloroquine and its analog hydroxychloroquine have been called &ldquo;game changers&rdquo; by President Donald Trump. Both drugs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat malaria and other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.</p>
<p>A man living in Phoenix died and his wife was in critical care after the two took a non-pharmaceutical version of chloroquine in an attempt to prevent contracting the virus. His wife said he heard Trump tout the drug in a news conference.</p>
<p>On March 29, the FDA issued a limited emergency use authorization for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat patients hospitalized with Covid-19.</p>
<p>Despite limited evidence on the efficacy of the drugs for Covid-19, the US Department of Human Health Services said in a statement that anecdotal reports suggest they may be beneficial in the treatment of hospitalized patients. The FDA said the benefits outweigh the risks.</p>
<p>A path toward a vaccine</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Contagion,&rdquo; CDC research scientist Dr. Ally Hextall (Jennifer Ehle) stresses that it can take months, maybe a year, to be able to distribute a vaccine after testing, clinical trials, manufacturing and distribution. However, Hextall speeds up the process by inoculating herself with the final experimental vaccine, then is able to provide doses for human use in just several months.</p>
<p>Fictional CDC research scientist Dr. Ally Hextall leads testing of a MEV-1 vaccine.</p>
<p>In reality, leading infectious disease experts say the typical vaccine takes between 8 and 10 years to develop. American health officials are trying to fast track that time frame, as are laboratories around the world.</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Hotez, a leading expert on infectious disease and vaccine development at Baylor College of Medicine, Currently a year to 18 months is an optimistic time window for a possible coronavirus vaccine,Dr. Peter Hotez, a leading expert on infectious disease and vaccine development at Baylor College of Medicine, previously told CNN</p>
<p>That said, a novel coronavirus vaccine Phase I trial in the US gave the first dose to test the safety of the vaccine to a participant in March. This trial is meant to establish that the vaccine is safe and that participants immune systems respond well, but proving the vaccine effectively prevents infection will take many more months.</p>
<p>Life as we haven&rsquo;t known it</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Contagion,&rdquo; civil unrest rips at the fabric of society, leaving banks and grocery stores ransacked. Police seemed unable to respond to crime, as martial law prohibited travel between states to stop the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>That hasn&rsquo;t happened in real life. But, as in the film, a lot of us have spent weeks separated from friends, family and places we love, wondering when the pandemic will end so we can get back to life as we&rsquo;ve known it. People are under variations of restrictions on movement, including social distancing guidelines, shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders. On March 29, Trump extended social distancing guidelines to April 30.</p>
<p>In one of the final scenes of the film, after successful distribution of vaccines, people wait in an airport to board their flight. Some still wear masks, but when a man in line drops something, the man behind him touches his shoulder to catch his attention, then leans down to pick the item up for him. The man seems grateful. Naivety? Or, maybe it&rsquo;s a sign that the worst is behind them.</p>

<p>Fictional CDC head Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) gives the son of a CDC custodian his own intranasal vaccine near the end of the film. The boy hesitantly shakes Cheever&rsquo;s hand, expressing his gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know where this comes from, shaking hands?&rdquo; Cheever asked. &ldquo;It was a way of showing a stranger that you weren&rsquo;t carrying a weapon in the old days. You offered your empty right hand to show that you meant no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there are any concrete takeaways &ldquo;Contagion&rdquo; offers us, it&rsquo;s a reminder to stop touching your face, and a beacon of hope that this too shall pass.</p>
<p>We can only hope we will one day be able to reach out and touch again, thankful that our pandemic is over.

&ldquo;Contagion,&rdquo; a 2011 movie about a virus that cripples the world as it spreads, is one of the most popular films on numerous On Demand services.</p>
<p>Warner Bros, the movie&rsquo;s studio, announced it&rsquo;s only behind the &ldquo;Harry Potter&rdquo; franchise as the most in-demand title in its catalog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Contagion&rdquo; producer, Michael Shamberg, told Insider he is amazed by the movie&rsquo;s current popularity.</p>
<p>The movie did not have good test screening scores. And when it opened it got a C+ from CinemaScore, which polls audiences after seeing a movie.</p>
<p>But due to the coronavirus pandemic, the movie suddenly has a second life.</p>

<p>When &ldquo;Contagion&rdquo; came out in 2011, the idea that a virus could cripple the world seemed like horrifying fiction. Today, the coronavirus pandemic has made it a reality.</p>
<p>The health crisis has also catapulted the 9-year-old film into one of the most-watched movies right now. It&rsquo;s just the latest unlikely chapter for the film director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns teamed up to make when another project the Oscar-winning director was planning to do fell through.</p>
<p>Hollywood has made plenty of disaster movies over the decades, but often they are over-the-top and full of unrealistic scenarios. And when a virus is in the plot, it usually causes people to become zombies. Soderbergh and Burns weren&rsquo;t interested in any of that. Inspired by a 2006 TedTalk by Dr. Larry Brilliant, the duo wanted to make a story on what would really happen if a pandemic spread around the globe.</p>
<p>Made for around $60 million through Warner Bros., the movie included an ensemble cast of Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, and Marion Cotillard. It focused on a flu virus called MEV-1, which originated in Hong Kong and quickly spreads across the world killing millions and causing an apocalyptic-like existence for those still alive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The movie never tested great,&rdquo; one of the movie&rsquo;s producers, two-time Oscar-nominee Michael Shamberg, told Insider, looking back on the making of it. &ldquo;But people understood it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But would they come to see a movie about what happens to the world after a deadly virus cripples it?</p>
<p>The movie&rsquo;s opening days in theaters had everyone involved in the movie a little worried, as the CinemaScore polling from audiences coming out of the movie gave it a C+, according to Shamberg. But in the first sign that the movie could go against the odds, it was the top movie at the box office its opening weekend with a $22.4 million opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a movie people didn&rsquo;t love when they came out of it, but they told people about it and more people kept coming,&rdquo; said Shamberg of the movie&rsquo;s performance.</p>
<p>It went on to earn over $136 million at the global box office.</p>

<p>For any movie that would be the endnote. A successful run in theaters and going forward, DVD and Blu-ray copies of it would collect dust on shelves and a small thumbnail of the movie&rsquo;s poster would appear as an option to watch on streaming services.</p>
<p>But then the coronavirus hit and suddenly &ldquo;Contagion&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t seem like a horror or disaster movie, but a documentary. Everything in the movie was a mirror to what was on the news.</p>
<p>Both viruses originated in China. &ldquo;Social distancing&rdquo; — a term used in the movie — became a phrase for everyday life. And by the end of the movie, all you want to do is wash your hands.</p>
<p>As the coronavirus began to spread in January, the movie title spiked on Google Trends. By March, Warner Bros. announced that &ldquo;Contagion&rdquo; was only behind the &ldquo;Harry Potter&rdquo; franchise as the most in-demand title in its catalog to view online (it was the studio&rsquo;s 270th most popular in December 2019). And currently, the movie is the most rented/purchased title on FandangoNow out of its non-new releases, while over on iTunes it has been in the top ten for weeks of titles viewed.</p>

<p>Shamberg said he&rsquo;s amazed by the movie&rsquo;s popularity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think in the history of cinema anything has happened like this before,&rdquo; he said, giving all the credit to Soderbergh, Burns, and the experts who were hired to be consultants on the movie. &ldquo;We should not forget that we need cinema both to entertain us, take our minds off of stuff, but also it is the most powerful medium for informing people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shamberg was working on a TV pilot with Soderbergh before the coronavirus caused all production in Hollywood to shut down, so he has been able to talk with the director about the movie&rsquo;s second life. And it seems Soderbergh feels the movie did its job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s just pleased that his vision as a filmmaker is out there, which was wanting to scare people into learning something,&rdquo; Shamberg said. &ldquo;He accomplished his mission.&rdquo;
