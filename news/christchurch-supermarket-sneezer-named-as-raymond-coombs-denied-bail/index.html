The 38-year-old was arrested after sharing a since-deleted Facebook video in which he coughed and sneezed on shoppers at Fresh Choice supermarket in Barrington.</p>
<p>He has been charged with endangering life by criminal nuisance and obstruction of a medical officer of health, police told Newshub.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the supermarket told Stuff the man has apologised and claimed the video was a &ldquo;drunken prank&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fresh Choice Barrington has put a number of extra steps in place over and above the norm to ensure the store is clean and safe for people to shop and work in,&rdquo; she told the outlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would strongly discourage any customers from doing anything like this in any supermarket. The police have been very clear that it&rsquo;s irresponsible and unacceptable behaviour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During Sunday&rsquo;s update on New Zealand&rsquo;s COVID-19 outbreak and response, Ardern noted that &ldquo;idiots&rdquo; are tarnishing the country&rsquo;s otherwise &ldquo;strong&rdquo; compliance with lockdown protocol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While compliance has been generally strong, there are still some I would charitably describe as idiots,&rdquo; she told reporters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A 38-year-old man, arrested last night after being seen on a video online coughing at people in a supermarket, I include in that description.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="rest-home-at-centre-of-covid-19-cluster-named">Rest home at centre of Covid-19 cluster named</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.odt.co.nz/sites/default/files/styles/odt_story_opengraph_1200w/public/story/2020/04/rest_home.jpg?itok=-zUgEK5v" alt="img">
Rosewood Rest Home &amp; Hospital. Photo: <a href="http://www.eldernet.co.nz">www.eldernet.co.nz</a></p>
<p>Rosewood Rest Home &amp; Hospital in Linwood has been identified as the Christchurch care home at the centre of a Covid-19 cluster.</p>
<p>The care home was identified by health officials today.</p>
<p>In an update to media, New Zealand&rsquo;s Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield announced there were 16 confirmed and probable cases among residents and staff at the facility.</p>
<p>A cluster of 10 cases were reportedly connected to the dementia unit at the facility.</p>
<p>Twenty residents have been moved to Burwood Hospital. Canterbury District Health Board staff have contacted next of kin of the 20 residents and are contacting the families of the remaining 44 residents.</p>
<p>The Rosewood Rest Home and Hospital has a total of 64 residents.</p>
<p>In addition to the 20 transferred to Burwood Hospital, there are an additional 44 residents with dementia remaining at the rest home in two separate wings.</p>
<p>All residents are being treated as close contacts and will be tested if they display symptoms of Covid-19.</p>
<p>This relocation means the 20 residents will be able to isolate as a group in their ‘bubble’ at Burwood Hospital.</p>
<p>While the residents are there, Rosewood will carry out a deep clean before the residents move back when the CDHB knows all residents are clear of infection.</p>
<p>CDHB chief executive David Meates said it is working to secure additional experienced staff to care for the 44 remaining residents at Rosewood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we are unable to source appropriate staff we may have to look at further relocations, although this is not the current plan,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>“Our priority is to ensure that all residents of Rosewood Rest Home receive quality care in a safe environment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to reassure all the families involved that everyone is working together to ensure this is the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a separate case to George Manning Lifecare &amp; Village in Spreydon, where two residents tested positive last week.</p>
<p>Heritage Lifecare chief executive Norah Barlow today said the two George Manning residents affected, who are in isolation and receiving onsite medical treatment, are &ldquo;both doing well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she also revealed that two staff members have also tested positive but are &ldquo;also both doing well&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Dr Bloomfield has revealed 67 new cases in NZ, bringing the total national number to 1106</p>
<p>The number of cases being definitively treated as community transmission has climbed from about 1% to 2%. But the cause of transmission was still being investigated for a number of cases.</p>
<p>The areas where there were the most number of cases still being investigated were in the Southern, Waikato and Auckland DHB areas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the number of cases linked to the Bluff wedding cluster had climbed to 62.</p>
<p>There have been no additional deaths and 176 people have recovered.</p>
<p>There are 13 people in hospital including three in ICU, one of whom is critical.</p>
<p>Two people have been discharged from hospital since yesterday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a Christchurch man charged with filming himself deliberately coughing on supermarket shoppers has appeared in court today.</p>
<p>Raymond Gary Coombs, 38, faced two charges at Christchurch District Court where he appeared from custody via audio-video link this morning.</p>
<p>One charge is of criminal nuisance - and one is of failing to follow a Medical Officer of Health&rsquo;s orders.</p>
<p>The latter charge carries a maximum penalty of six months in prison.</p>
<p>Coombs was remanded in custody until Thursday while the court awaits his Covid-19 test results.

<h3 id="covid-19-coronavirus-prime-minister-jacinda-ardern-gives-further-update-on-life-after-lockdown">Covid 19 coronavirus: Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern gives further update on life after lockdown</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/sH5zFlWjm3GQaq-oQucKQCjIPFY=/1200x0/smart/filters:quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-syd-prod-nzme.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4ZA5ENIJEFDXTA7OZQIKWSSOCY.jpg" alt="img">
New Zealand won&rsquo;t be coming out of alert level 4 lockdown earlier than the full four weeks, despite promising signs, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says.</p>
<p>Ardern is giving a press conference in the Beehive in Wellington, updating the public on the latest decisions about the response to the Covid 19 pandemic.</p>
<p>On how long we&rsquo;ll stay in level 4 lockdown, Ardern said she didn&rsquo;t want New Zealand to be locked down &ldquo;a minute more&rdquo; than necessary.</p>
<p>But we won&rsquo;t be brought out of lockdown early, she said.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t want the gains in the first half of the lockdown to be lost in the second half.</p>
<p>Ardern said the four-week lockdown allowed health authorities to see where the spread had happened but should have stopped further transmissions.</p>
<p>It would be four weeks minimum, she said.</p>
<p>Ardern said every day of the four weeks was important because it showed where the infections were because of the lag with Covid 19.</p>
<p>The four weeks would show where community transmission had happened.</p>
<p>We have positive signs, but Ardern said &ldquo;we shouldn&rsquo;t get ahead of ourselves&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Surveillance testing would start for the &ldquo;latter half of the lockdown&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A total of 876,000 people had shared in $5.3 billion paid out through the wage subsidy scheme which the Prime Minister said was extraordinary given it&rsquo;s only existed a few weeks.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Between $8 and $12 billion will eventually be paid out through the scheme, the Treasury estimates.</p>
<p>A searchable database will be available shortly for employees to see if their workplace has applied for it.</p>
<p>Ardern said she was looking at the possibility of taking a pay cut in light of the pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t rule that out,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Ardern is paid $471,000 a year and she and other ministers are acutely aware of the financial issues many New Zealanders now faced.</p>
<p>Ardern said she knew there were people feeling stressed, nervous and anxious during the lockdown.</p>
<p>Campaigns and resources will be released tomorrow to help Kiwis cope with the mental health impacts of Covid-19 and the lockdown.</p>
<p>Today there were 67 cases of Covid-19, bringing the total to 1106.</p>
<p>On digital solutions for contact-tracing, she said &ldquo;no one wants to reinvent the wheel&rdquo; and the Government was looking to other countries, like Singapore, which used it with success.</p>
<p>But no app compared to the interrogation which a human was able to do, she said.</p>
<p>The Government was having to design a means of sentinel testing, or random testing, as fewer people were presenting to their GPs.</p>
<p>On butchers, bakers and greengrocers, they&rsquo;re not allowed to open their shops but can operate online.</p>
<p>On solo parents struggling to juggle shopping and childcare during lockdown, Ardern said essential workers had some provision for care.</p>
<p>For those who are sole parents they should have the flexibility to take them to the supermarket with them.</p>
<p>The jury was still out on whether the general public should be using face masks out in public.</p>
<p>On Bridges driving between Tauranga and Parliament, Ardern said ministers had advice and it was up to them.</p>
<p>There were digital solutions, she said.</p>
<p>Ardern said it wasn&rsquo;t for her to determine how the Opposition operated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is ultimately up to those MPs to make those decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the RNZ/TVNZ merger, Ardern said the pandemic showed how important it was for people to access information but the fact that advertising revenue was diluted. She expected to &ldquo;expedite&rdquo; this area.</p>
<p>On the Sylvia Park landlord asking for full rent, Ardern asked for compassion.</p>
<p>She said the Government had been looking more widely at rent issues.</p>
<p>As well as the organised charter flight to Peru, Ardern said they&rsquo;d also been able to extract 11 New Zealanders from the Tyrol region of Austria.</p>
<p>Today Prime Minister Ardern responded to children asking about visits from the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy during coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>The tooth fairy and the Easter Bunny are both deemed to be essential workers but Ardern said children should know the Easter Bunny might be a bit busy this year and might not be able to get every house.</p>
<p>On quarantining at the border, Ardern said they had to ensure any change was sustainable long-term and that was being worked through.</p>
<p>Ardern said it would be &ldquo;absolutely wrong&rdquo; to ask for Health Minister David Clark&rsquo;s resignation after he drove to mountain bike on a trail in Wellington despite lockdown guidelines banning the risky activity.</p>
<p>The last patients from the Whakaari/White Island eruption have been discharged from the National Burns Centre at Middlemore, she said.</p>
<p>She thanked the staff at Middlemore and other health care workers across New Zealand involved in the response to the eruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do incredible work - very, very difficult work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Cyclone Harold, she said it was concerning and looked like it was coming into the Pacific with considerable force and the Defence Force was at the ready and Covid-19 didn&rsquo;t change that.</p>
<p>DHBs should be making sure frontline healthcare workers had the PPE they needed &ldquo;because the supply is there&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said a number of data points showed New Zealand&rsquo;s cases were &ldquo;quite comfortably&rdquo; levelling off.</p>
<p>It was encouraging, he said.</p>
<p>But he wasn&rsquo;t able to say what life in alert level 3 would be and which businesses - like bars and cafes - would be able to open.</p>
<p>But Bloomfield said he hoped it would look &ldquo;different enough&rdquo;.</p>
<p>‌</p>
<p>Two per cent of cases have been confirmed as community transmission.</p>
<p>The increase in community transmission showed what they were expecting, Bloomfield said.
