South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa was captured struggling to get his facemask on after delivering a speech on the importance of wearing them, in a blunder livestreamed yesterday.</p>
<p>Before suffering the face mask mishap President Ramaphosa annouced that the nation would be easing some of their lockdown restrictions from next month.</p>
<p>He urged those leaving their homes to travel on public transport to wear face masks, and then attempted to give an instructive demonstration on how to wear a mask - which did not go to plan.</p>
<p>Scroll down for video.</p>
<p>South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa was captured struggling to get his facemask on after delivering a speech on the importance of wearing them in a blunder livestreamed yesterday</p>
<p>Leading by example the president stretches the fabric mask around one of his ears, but struggles to hook the other ear in the elastic.</p>
<p>A second later the mask rebels, pinging off his face before President Ramaphosa firmly places it back over his ears, this time leaving his eyes covered by the mask like a blindfold.</p>
<p>Twitter humourously reacted to the video clip of the president grappling with the mask which was shared widely on social media.</p>
<p>The president stretched the elastic of a fabric mask around one of his ears, but struggled to hook the other ear, leaving his eyes covered by the mask</p>
<p>The president begins his demonstration well but struggles to secure the mask on his right ear</p>
<p>He secures the mask without touching his face, which is the advised way to put on a mask according to Professor of infectious diseases Marc Mendelson at the University of Cape town</p>
<p>[ON-AIR] President Cyril Ramaphosa responds after his mask blunder goes viral. Courtsey #DStv403 Posted by eNCAnews on Friday, 24 April 2020</p>
<p>Using the hashtags #MaskOnChallenge and #CyrilMaskChallenge people shared posts of themselves incorrectly wearing face masks over their eyes.</p>
<p>Mixo Maluleke, a marketing student from Tshwane, South Africa, share a picture of himself wearing a mask as the president did</p>
<p>Today the president responded to the social media reaction, telling Enca: &lsquo;Well for those of you who were laughing at me yesterday, I am going to open a TV channel where i&rsquo;m going to teach poeple to put on a mask. So you can enroll how a mask is put on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One Twitter user posted: &lsquo;My family and I laughed. Even the sign language lady was a bit more passionate throughout the whole speech and suddenly at the end she ran out of signs.</p>
<p>Adding: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think Mr President will mind a little #MaskOnChallenge We have more than enough sulk moments. Let&rsquo;s laugh a little.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While Roxanne Konkol tweeted: &lsquo;Something positive. Thanks Cyril for the giggles #maskchallenge #MaskOnChallenge #Masks #CyrilFridays.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some even went as far as creating mock &lsquo;Fifty Shades Of Grey&rsquo; movie posters, which featured the president wearing the mask as a blindfold with the words &lsquo;Fifty Shades Of Lockdown&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Others did not find the jokes about the mask blunder amusing, Busisiwe Ntshingila tweeted: &lsquo;Not funny not after all we have been through can you imagine how tired that man must be, where many failed he has protected us, give him a break and show some respect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Twitter user Aumento shares a picture of himself trying to put on a homemade mask in a haphazzard way</p>
<p>Mzie Ozias compared the president&rsquo;s new look to an eye mask joking &lsquo;we have been doing it wrong&rsquo;</p>
<p>On March 26 South Africa went into a 21-day lockdown, this has since been extended with most people urged to stay at home, however some measures will be lifted.</p>
<p>The total ban on cigarette sells will also be eased from next month. A total ban on alcohol sales remains in place.</p>
<p>Some schools are expected to reopen with limitations placed on class sizes.

<h3 id="risk-factors-9-major-takeaways-from-ramaphosas-lockdown-speech">Risk factors: 9 major takeaways from Ramaphosa’s lockdown speech</h3>
<p><img src="http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10113/d6b6f3052c4f4526818c45d33e834b92.jpg" alt="img">
President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced that as of 1 May, some measures of the nationwide lockdown implemented in March will be eased.</p>
<p>The easing of restrictions will focus on reviving economic activity, and Ramaphosa said on Thursday stringent public health and safety measures would remain in place for those sectors identified to resume some business activities.</p>
<p>READ | Ramaphosa&rsquo;s full speech on easing the lockdown</p>
<p>For the public at large, and for those with underlying conditions, lockdown regulations would still apply if they did not work in a sector that would be allowed to partially reopen.</p>
<p>Here are nine key points from Ramaphosa&rsquo;s address:</p>
<ol>
<li>Risk levels</li>
</ol>
<p>A strategy has been developed whereby the country, provinces, districts and metros will be classified on a five-level risk scale - one being low risk to five being the highest risk level - which will determine the restrictions in place at any given time. South Africa would move to Level 4 as of 1 May.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This approach is guided by the advice from scientists who have advised that an abrupt and uncontrolled lifting of restrictions could cause a massive resurgence in infections,&rdquo; Ramaphosa said.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Travel bans remain in place</li>
</ol>
<p>The international travel ban implemented on 15 March would remain in place, and travel between provinces would still be restricted other than for the transportation of essential goods, or funerals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Public transport will continue to operate, with limitations on the number of passengers and stringent hygiene requirements, including that all passengers must wear a face mask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The public is encouraged to stay at home, other than for essential personal movement, doing essential work and work in sectors that are under controlled opening. People can exercise under strict public health conditions,&rdquo; Ramaphosa said.</p>
<p>The lockdown will be eased over time. (Rudi Louw/News24)</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Cigarettes back on the shelves</li>
</ol>
<p>After weeks of intense lobbying and threats of court action from tobacco companies, cigarettes will again be sold in stores.</p>
<p>The categories of goods allowed to be sold at stores will be expanded to include more items, which will be communicated in the coming week.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>More than 70 000 SANDF members to be deployed</li>
</ol>
<p>Ramaphosa confirmed he had deployed over 70 000 defence force personnel, in addition to those already deployed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until now, those defence force members who have been deployed have supported the South African Police Service in their responsibilities. They will continue to do so, but they will also be providing assistance in other essential areas, such as the provision of water supply, infrastructure maintenance and health services,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Sector approach</li>
</ol>
<p>Economic activity will be allowed to resume to a certain degree and will be based on analysis of risk levels in each separate sector.</p>
<p>Sector bodies would be asked in the coming week to provide input, which will shape the sectors identified and the restrictions that will be placed on them.</p>
<p>Ramaphosa said strict health and safety measures would be implemented and enforced, while the government would encourage continued work-from-home strategies for staff who could do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have undertaken a detailed exercise to classify the different parts of the economy according to the risk of transmission in that sector, the expected impact of the lockdown, the economic contribution of the sector and the effect on livelihoods. The relevant ministers will provide a detailed briefing on the classification of industries and how each is affected at each level,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Some exercise will be allowed</li>
</ol>
<p>People would be allowed out of their homes to exercise under specific circumstances and provided they took the necessary safety precautions.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Much remains unknown</li>
</ol>
<p>Ramaphosa said the risk-adjusted approach was necessary because an abrupt and sudden lifting of the lockdown could result in an explosion of Covid-19 cases - because it was likely the number of cases far exceeded confirmed and reported numbers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have decided on this approach because there is still much that is unknown about the rate and manner of the spread of the virus within our population. The action we take now must therefore be measured and incremental.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to balance the need to resume economic activity with the imperative to contain the virus and save lives. To achieve this, we have developed an approach that determines the measures we should have in place based on the direction of the pandemic in our country,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Social gatherings and bars remain closed</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;It is important to note that several restrictions will remain in place regardless of the level of alert for as long as the risk of transmission is present,&rdquo; Ramaphosa said.</p>
<p>Bars and shebeens would remain closed as well as conference and convention centres, entertainment venues, cinemas and theatres, while concerts, sporting events, and religious, cultural and social gatherings would not be allowed until it was deemed safe for them to continue, he added.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>75% of the country&rsquo;s Covid-19 cases are in metro areas</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;From the evidence we have, we know that 75% of confirmed coronavirus cases are found in just six metro municipalities - Johannesburg, Ekurhuleni, Cape Town, Buffalo City, Ethekwini and Mangaung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is therefore essential that we do everything in our means to restrict the movement of people and - although it runs counter to our very nature - to reduce the contact that each of us has with each other,&rdquo; Ramaphosa said.</p>
