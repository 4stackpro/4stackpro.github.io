Here’s what you need to know about it and how to get involved.</p>
<p>What is World Autism Day?</p>
<p>Every year since 2008, United Nations member states have been encouraged to observe World Autism Awareness Day in order to raise awareness of autism and aspergers syndrome around the world.</p>
<p>World Autism Day is celebrated every year on 2 April to raise awareness about people with autistic spectrum disorders throughout the world Copyright: Other 3rd Party</p>
<p>Sign up to our daily newsletter The i newsletter cut through the noise Sign up Thanks for signing up! Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later. Submitting&hellip;</p>
<p>Buildings, homes and communities come together on April 2 in recognition of people with autism and those who love and support them.</p>
<p>Autism-friendly events and educational activities usually take place all month, as part of World Autism Awareness Month, throughout the month of April.</p>
<p>These aim to increase understanding and acceptance of people with autism, alongside encouraging worldwide support and a kinder, more inclusive world.</p>
<p>What is autism?</p>
<p>The National Autistic Society explains that, “Autism is a lifelong disability which affects how people communicate and interact with the world. There are approximately 700,000 autistic adults and children in the UK.</p>
<p>“Autism is a spectrum condition. All autistic people share certain difficulties, but being autistic will affect them in different ways.</p>
<p>“Some autistic people also have learning disabilities, mental health issues or other conditions, meaning people need different levels of support. All people on the autism spectrum learn and develop.”</p>
<p>What is this year’s theme?</p>
<p>This year’s World Autism Awareness Day 2020 theme is &lsquo;The Transition to Adulthood&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The transition to adulthood is an important challenge for those with autism, and this theme therefore draws attention to the adulthood stage of people with autism.</p>
<p>Issues include the importance of participation in cultural youth events, community, decision making, education, and how those with autism should have access to post-secondary education and employment, alongside being able to live independently.</p>
<p>World Autism Awareness Week 2020</p>
<p>World Autism Awareness Week, which is organised by the National Autistic Society, runs from Monday 30 March to Sunday 5 April 2020.</p>
<p>The National Autistic Society explains that, “In the week of 30 March - 5 April we encourage the public to take part in World Autism Awareness Week – a full seven days where people across the UK take part in activities to raise money and awareness for the National Autistic Society.”</p>
<p>Although the UK is currently under lockdown due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the charity explains that there are still a variety of ways you can “spread awareness, and get advice and support from our charity during this difficult time”.</p>
<p>The organisation adds: “We need your help now more than ever to continue to provide support to autistic people and their families, who fear change and feel isolated more than most under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>“If you are in a position to do so, we’ve made it easy for you to do fundraising activities during the week from the safety of your home.”</p>
<p>7 ways you can still get involved from home, according to Autism.org.uk:</p>

HOUSTON – April 2nd is World Autism Awareness Day and KPRC 2 is once again proud to partner with Autism Speaks to help support families across the Houston area.</p>
<p>Today as part of World Autism Awareness Day, KPRC2 Owen Conflenti is reading a book written by a local mom and illustrated by her son who is an award-winning artist and advocate for others on the autism spectrum like himself. Big thanks to Jigsaw Grant and LongTale Publishing for allowing us to share the book “Grant the Jigsaw Giraffe: Different is More” with you today. After the story, KPRC2 Britta Merwin has an interview with the author and illustrator. Autism Speaks Houston. Posted by KPRC2 / Click2Houston on Thursday, April 2, 2020</p>
<p>This year in honor of the day, KPRC 2 anchor Owen Conflenti read “Grant the Jigsaw Giraffe: Different is More” on Facebook Live. The book, published by LongTale Publishing, was written by local mom Julie Coy and was illustrated by her son Grant. Grant is an award-winning artist who has a knack for recycling materials like paper, magazines, even puzzle pieces to create amazing collages. After hearing the book, you can check out his incredible gallery here.</p>
<p>KPRC 2 meteorologist Britta Merwin also interviewed Grant and his mom in order to help raise additional awareness about autism in the month of April.</p>
<p>Britta initially connected with Grant and his mom because of her own personal connection to autism. One of Britta’s sons is on the spectrum and she has publicly shared her experiences in order to help other parents be advocates for their own children. You can find Britta’s “Parent’s Guide to Autism” whenever you need it on our website.

<p><img src="https://images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/autism-AP-1200-min.jpg" alt="img">
What is ‘normal’? In this fortnightly column, Srinidhi Raghavan explores the understanding of bodies-minds and navigating spaces as disabled, chronically ill and sick people. Read more from the series here.</p>
<hr>
<p>As 2 April draws close, I find myself watching how the media covers autism. The date is observed as World Autism Day, with initiatives such as “Light It Up Blue” meant to raise awareness. Yet, world over, autistic people have challenged the normative idea of “lighting it up blue” with its harmful connotations, and sought a shift from ‘awareness’ to ‘acceptance’, celebrating April as #AutismAcceptanceMonth.</p>
<p>Autistics have reminded us repeatedly that they prefer identity-first language — i.e. they prefer to be called ‘Autistic people’ (identity first) over ‘person with autism’ (people first). This debate over how to address disabled people has been ongoing within the community and outside, with allies and governments, forever. However, non-disabled people all over the world shy away from using the word disabled, or autistic, deaf etc. They are far more comfortable with soft versions of the same word — focussing on the difference. Their behaviour, however, doesn’t reflect any acceptance of this difference.</p>
<p>Priyangee, a lawyer, defines autism as a spectrum. “Not everyone who is on the spectrum experiences autism in the same way. Therefore, do not assume that our ability to live life is limited in all ways. Do not use our diagnosis to make us feel small,” she says. This sentiment resonated with two other individuals I spoke with as well. For Rakshita, a teacher supporting students with special needs in an inclusive school in Hyderabad, accepting autism meant “giving up your way of thinking and being and willing to constantly unlearn and relearn”. A disaster risk professional, @TheBoyWhoGrewUpAsAnAspie was specifically advised not to talk about his diagnosis on Facebook and Instagram. “People don’t understand these things, is what I keep getting told,” he says.</p>
<p>Feeling the need for an outlet, @TheBoyWhoGrewUpAsAnAspie began writing a blog anonymously and found the process therapeutic. One of his concerns was that the moment someone says they are autistic, the non-disabled and neurotypical (those who are neither on the spectrum nor have any other developmental disability) think of it as disease. The focus is on “curing” the autistic person. “To be honest, this is the way I was born. I am just a different cup of tea, you know? Just because my brain is not wired like yours doesn’t mean I need to be ‘fixed’. There is a jumble of wires in my brain and I am learning to navigate these connections. It may be different from yours, but this doesn’t mean you isolate me,” he notes.</p>
<p>Priyangee also attests to how the diagnosis shifts people’s perceptions of you. She says, “One of the reasons I am glad I didn’t have an early diagnosis is, I know society would have limited the opportunities I could avail — not because I lack in ability, which I clearly don’t, but because they’d think I lack the ability to navigate through the neurotypical world.”</p>
<p>While receiving a diagnosis offers a certain happiness, a sense of finding home, it also results in a lot of discrimination and boxing. People associate the diagnosis with limitations more than with possibilities. For many of us in the disabled, autistic, illness community, being diagnosed means finding community, finding language.</p>
<p>“I was really happy when I got diagnosed,” says @TheBoyWhoGrewUpAsAnAspie. “I still smile thinking of that moment. I had a lot of anger issues back then and I was constantly thinking why am I suffering while others around me are enjoying [life]. The diagnosis helped me shift from seeing it as a problem to learning to manage it. Till my diagnosis, I didn’t know how to adopt [coping] strategies. Then, I learnt to manage it.”</p>
<p>The many myths attached to autistics include they “have no empathy”, “are uncontrollable”, “throw tantrums” etc. In this piece on being an ally to autistic people, therapist Prathama Raghavan quotes a young man as saying: “It’s not as if you (non-autistic folk) can empathise with the autistic experience, so maybe it is not a question of empathy?” A particular myth that came up in my conversations bears attending to: the use of terms like “high functioning” and “low functioning”. Amethyst explains this in her video, ‘Ask An Autistic — What about functioning labels?’ The label was created to rate how much an autistic person could do, and to assist in managing their tasks.</p>
<p>However, many autistic people have felt that even within the individual, a spectrum of functioning exists. “There is no such thing as ‘high functioning autism’,” says Priyangee. “If we seem high functioning in one area, it often comes at the cost of ‘functioning’ in other area. My high functioning at work comes at the cost of being messy at home. I cannot manage both, physically and mentally.”</p>
<p>One of the reasons it is believed to be so, Lydia XZ Brown says in a post on functioning labels, is because “most people equate ‘autistic’ with unintelligent, incapable of doing anything, relegated to special education, unable to complete post-secondary education, anti-social, incapable of choosing to have or not have sexual or romantic relationships, and eternally infantile. These ideas arise because of the ableism that is so pervasive in our society”.</p>
<p>This in many ways reinforces what I addressed in my previous column about being able to pass, or the arduous process of “faking well”. The idea of who is disabled is such a narrow line that I am not sure any of us can walk on it without falling right off.</p>
<p>How then do we behave around autistic people? Rakshita puts it simply: “Listen to autistics. Let them communicate however they want. Speech is not a superior way of communication. And autistic communication is not deficient. But most importantly, don’t try to change us. Change your perception, even if it is validated by a majority.” Or, as she writes in these verses —</p>
<p>Just as I welcome you</p>
<p>Take courage to let me in, too</p>
<p>Let’s intertwine, let’s dance,</p>
<p>Let’s flutter, let’s stutter,</p>
<p>Let’s hum to our different rhythms</p>
<p>Let’s find our own harmony</p>
<p>Listen…</p>
<p>Let’s make being together our mission.</p>
