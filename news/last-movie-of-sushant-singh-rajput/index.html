<p>In Photos: From Maanav in Pavitra Rishta to Annirudh in Chhichhore, roles that defined Sushant Singh Rajput 1 12 Tracing Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s life in films Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s tryst with the camera began with a chance sighting. Ekta Kapoor&rsquo;s casting team spotted him in a play by Nadira Babbar&rsquo;s theatre company and invited him to audition for a show. It set the ball rolling on the then-aspiring hero&rsquo;s career. A look: Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil (2008) Sushant made his television debut as Preet Juneja on this show. The character was killed early on, but was brought back as a spirit for the series finale, owing to his popularity. Pavitra Rishta (2009) The next year, he landed the lead role of Manav Deshmukh in the hit show, widely considered to be his breakout role and a stepping stone to films. While working on this Ekta Kapoor production, he also met his future girlfriend, Ankita Lokhande, who played the female lead. Kai Po Che! (2013) After participating in two dance-based reality shows— Zara Nachke Dikha 2 and Jhalak Dikhhla Ja 4—Sushant auditioned for this Abhishek Kapoor directorial, and bagged one of the three lead roles alongside Rajkummar Rao and Amit Sadh. His portrayal of former district-level cricketer Ishaan Bhatt, who falls prey to politics in the selection process, in the critical and commercial success earned him raves. Shuddh Desi Romance (2013) Sushant followed it up with this Maneesh Sharma-directed Parineeti Chopra and Vaani Kapoor co-starrer. The romance comedy-drama was set in Jaipur and revolved around youngsters’ take on love and live-in relationships. PK (2014) In Rajkumar Hirani’s satirical comedy-drama led by Aamir Khan and Anushka Sharma, Sushant had a brief yet notable role. Detective Byomkesh Bakshy (2015) Dibakar Banerjee’s mystery thriller featured the actor in the titular role, a character created by Bengali writer Sharanindu Bandopadhyay. Set in the Kolkata of the 1940s, the film was reportedly to get a sequel with Sushant reprising his role. MS Dhoni: The Untold Story (2016) Neeraj Pandey’s biographical drama that traces the journey of the eponymous former Indian skipper-wicket keeper saw Sushant take on another titular role. The film, which also featured Kiara Advani and Disha Patani, secured for Sushant his first Filmfare Best Actor nomination the following year. Raabta (2017) In Dinesh Vijan’s directorial debut, a reincarnation-themed romance actioner, Sushant was paired opposite Kriti Sanon and the duo played star-crossed lovers. The film featured Jim Sarbh, Rajkumar Yadav and Varun Dharma in supporting roles. Kedarnath (2018) The actor reunited with Abhishek ‘Gattu’ Kapoor to headline Sara Ali Khan’s launch vehicle. The inter-faith love story was set against the backdrop of the pilgrim site and revolved around a Muslim boy who falls in love with a rich Brahmin girl. Sonchiriya (2019) Co-written and directed by Abhishek Chaubey, the film is set in the Chambal ravines of 1975 and tells the story of a group of dacoits. It also featured Manoj Bajpayee, Bhumi Pednekar, Ranvir Shorey and Ashutosh Rana. Chhichhore (2019) Sushant followed it up with one of the biggest successes of his career with this Nitesh Tiwari-directed campus comedy-drama. The film won five Filmfare nods, including Best Film and Best Director. It was also Sushant’s last theatrical release.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput was known as someone perennially brimming with ideas and young energy. So, many didn&rsquo;t bat an eyelid while reading his last post on Instagram. Shared with a picture of his late mother on June 3, the post seemed like an inconspicuous observation in line with the general mood across social media feeds&hellip; until Sunday afternoon, when news of the actor’s suicide broke.A student of metaphysics and spirituality, Sushant was a stickler for perfection when it came to his craft. He passed up six films and devoted six months to Shekhar Kapur&rsquo;s futuristic sci-fi romantic drama, Paani, which revolved around water wars. Prep for the 34-year-old actor meant reading and re-reading the script, understanding the character, his back story, where he was coming from and where he was headed. Talking to Mirror (September 14, 2015), he had pointed out that he could have sixpack abs but not for show, “because this guy lives in the Lower City, where everybody fights to get something to eat and then, there&rsquo;s no water”. It was only when he realised thatwould go on the floors before Paani, that he shifted focus to the biopic, spending 18 months ‘becoming’ the titular character with former Indian wicketkeeper Kiran More. “Complete immersion is important, more so when you&rsquo;re playing a real-life living character. Viewers must feel you are him and not pretending to be him,&rdquo; he had reasoned, admitting that there were times when he felt like he was talking like Dhoni.During that interview, he was asked what if he could fast forward to 2040, when Paani unfolds, and he looked horrified, “I wouldn&rsquo;t even jump a year ahead, forget 25 years. I’m a control freak, which is why I can&rsquo;t sleep at night for longer than four-five hours. My friends insisted that I consult a doctor, who told me that I was excited and restless for no particular reason, which is why I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. Also, I was afraid that if I did, I would lose control.”Sushant was a National Olympiad winner in physics, and having grown up in a large family, had learnt the value of money early on, when he couldn’t pursue his dream of going to Stanford University. Instead, he took the All India Engineering Entrance Exam (popularly known as AIEEE) and came seventh, securing a seat in the prestigious Delhi College of Engineering. However, he dropped out in the final year. “If I had waited another six months, I could have come to Mumbai with a degree. I take time to make decisions, but once it is made, there are no regrets or uncertainty,” he had pointed out.Starting out with TV soaps like Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil and Pavitra Rishta, he made a smooth transition to films with Abhishek Kapoor’s!, for which he bagged a Filmfare Award for Best Debut. With just 10 releases, his filmography is short but varied, with films like, Detective Byomkesh Bakshy, PK, Kedarnath and his last release, Chhichhore, in which Sushant played a doting dad trying to revive his son from a coma caused by a suicide attempt.Around the release of the Abhishek Chaubey-directed dacoit drama,, the actor had told Mirror that he has 12 films in the pipeline. “It’s for me to decide what to do next…There is no film that I want to do that I can’t do,” he had stated confidently. His last film, Dil Bechara, an official adaptation of The Fault In Our Stars, was gearing up for a direct-to-digital release.Two years ago, the actor had flown down to National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to train as anto play one in a film, which he later opted out of, but not before buying a piece of land on the moon and promising to come up with his own space film. Then, as a part of his 50-dreams-to-realise list, he wanted to send kids for workshops at Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and NASA. He would regularly study constellations in the sky from the terrace of his Pavana home, also going fishing, boating and swimming in the lake close by. But he had clarilifed that both the Bandra apartment and this holiday home were rented. “The only property I own is on the Moon, besides the Maserati, which was a childhood dream,” he had informed.During the lockdown, the actor was learning how to code for his love of computer games. He even listed down tried-and-tested methods to optimise Return of Investment on time, advising fans to get seven hours of sleep, meditate regularly, journal, exercise, optimise digital time and practice intermittent fasting to upgrade their quality of life. His words, &ldquo;If you give me more money and fame, I will keep it because I am smart, but if I don’t get it, I won’t worry because I have enough already,” spoken during an interview, resonate as we bid him adieu.Last year, he had confided that for his 33rd birthday on January 21, he had wanted to fly to Norway and paint the Northern Lights. It was one of the many things on his 150-to-do list that remained incomplete.

<p><img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-01/f747m5no_sushant-singh-rajput_625x300_15_January_19.jpg" alt="img">
Actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai home.</p>
<p>Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his home in Mumbai, police said today, confirming his suicide. He was 34.</p>
<p>The popular actor was recently seen in the film &ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo; - which dealt with the extreme pressure of college and competitive exams. His last appearance was in the Netflix film &ldquo;Drive&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput had put up a moving post just last week when his former manager Disha Salian was found dead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such devastating news,&rdquo; the actor had written on Instagram.</p>
<p>His last post on Instagram was dedicated to his mother, whose death in 2002 left him devastated. &ldquo;Blurred past evaporating from teardrops, unending dreams carving an arc of smile And a fleeting life, negotiating between the two,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>Rajput, who became a household name with his hit television series &ldquo;Pavitra Rishta&rdquo;, debuted in films in 2013 with the critically acclaimed &ldquo;Kai Po Che!&rdquo; based on Chetan Bhagat&rsquo;s bestselling book &ldquo;The Three Mistakes of My Life&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The movie catapulted Rajput into the big league and he went on to do several films. He also played MS Dhoni in the former skipper&rsquo;s biopic, for which he was nominated for film awards.</p>
<p>He played the eponymous role of Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! in the 2015 thriller. He had a supporting role in Aamir Khan&rsquo;s 2014 hit PK. In 2018, Rajput starred in Kedarnath opposite debutante Sara Ali Khan.</p>
<p>Rajput was born in Patna. He studied engineering and was a National Olympiad Winner in Physics.</p>
<p>He said in interviews that after his involvement in theatre and dance, he rarely had time for studies. He eventually dropped out of engineering just a year short of his degree to pursue an acting career.</p>
<p>A shell-shocked film industry posted tributes on Twitter. &ldquo;Honestly this news has left me shocked and speechless&hellip;I remember watching #SushantSinghRajput in Chhichhore and telling my friend Sajid, its producer how much I&rsquo;d enjoyed the film and wish I&rsquo;d been a part of it. Such a talented actor&hellip;may God give strength to his family,&rdquo; Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No No No!!!!! Horrible heartbreaking news of the passing of #SushantSinghRajput ! Shocking &amp; sad beyond words!!! Goodbye Sushant.. you were such a wonderful performer and had such a long long way to go! Don&rsquo;t know what you were going through but I&rsquo;m sorry for your suffering! Red heart (sic),&rdquo; Swara Bhaskar posted, condoling his death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The news of Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s death is truly sad. What a tragic loss Deepest condolences to his family &amp; loved ones. May his soul find eternal peace,&rdquo; actor Ajay Devgn wrote.</p>
<p>Abhishek Bachchan tweeted: &ldquo;This is just so shocking. A wonderful talent. RIP Sushant&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Last month, death of seasoned actors - Rishi Kapoor and Irrfan Khan - left the country in grief and shock.</p>

<p>Updated: Jun 15, 2020 11:50 IST</p>
<p>Actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death should be investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Jan Adhikar Party chief Pappu Yadav demanded on Monday.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput, who dropped out of an engineering college to pursue a career in Bollywood and delivered several hit films over the past decade, was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai on Sunday. He was 34.</p>
<p>Dattatreya Bargude, an assistant commissioner of Mumbai Police, confirmed the actor’s death and said that no “note” was found at his residence.</p>
<p>“I cannot imagine how this happened. I request the government to launch a CBI inquiry. I think there is a deep conspiracy behind his death. Sushant cannot commit suicide,” Pappu Yadav told reporters.</p>
<p>“I want a CBI inquiry in the matter. Sushant was a workaholic and good man, not the kind of person that would commit suicide. He rose from the bottom. Made Bihar proud. Now the state of Bihar is in mourning,” he added.</p>
<p>Yadav also claimed that it could be a case of homicide.</p>
<p>Rajput was born in Bihar’s capital of Patna and was the youngest of five children of a government employee. He completed his schooling in Delhi before securing a seat in an engineering college in the Capital in 2003.</p>
<p>He dropped out of the course to pursue acting professionally three years later and joined the Barry John Acting School.</p>
<p>The actor landed his first role in the Hindi serial, Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil, in 2008 but gained popularity the next year with his character in the popular soap, Pavitra Rishta.</p>
<p>He debuted in Bollywood in 2013 with the movie Kai Po Che!, adapted from a novel by Chetan Bhagat but became a household name with the success of MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, a biopic on the World Cup-winning Indian cricket captain, in 2016.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput was last seen in Nitesh Tiwari’s Chhichhore in 2019 and also acted in the thriller Drive that was released on Netflix the same year.</p>

Sushant Singh Rajput Suicide: सुशांत सिंह राजपूत चले गए, लेकिन &lsquo;दिल बेचारा&rsquo; रह गया, निर्देशक मुकेश छाबड़ा ने की ये अपील</p>
<p>नई दिल्ली, जेएनएन। Sushant Singh Rajput Suicide: सुशांत सिंह राजपूत भी अब इस दुनिया को छोड़ गए। साल 2020 में फ़िल्म इंडस्ट्री को एक और बड़ा झटका दे गए। रविवार सुबह सुशांत ने बांद्रा में अपने घर पर फांसी लगा ली। उनके आत्महत्या करने के बाद फैंस काफी सदमे हैं। हालांकि, जाते-जाते वह अपनी आखिरी फ़िल्म छोड़ गए हैं।</p>
<p>मुकेश छाबरा बना रहे हैं दिल बेचारा</p>
<p>बॉलीवुड के फेमस कास्टिंग डायरेक्टर मुकेश छाबरा बतौर निर्देशक डेब्यू कर रहे हैं। उनकी फ़िल्म &lsquo;दिल बेचारा&rsquo; में सुशांत सिंह राजपूत लीड रोल में थे। सिनेमाघर बंद होने की वज़ह से फ़िल्म की ओटीटी पर रिलीज़ होने की ख़बर थी। ख़बरों के मुताबिक, फ़िल्म जल्द ही डिज़्नी प्लस हॉटस्टार पर रिलीज़ होने वाली थी। हालांकि, इसको लेकर मेकर्स ने कोई भी घोषणा नहीं की थीं।</p>

<p>मुकेश छाबरा की अपील</p>
<p>मुकेश छाबरा ना सिर्फ दिल बेचारा के निर्देशक थे, बल्कि सुशांत के करीब दोस्त थे। इस हादसे के बाद वह उनके घर भी पहुंचे। उन्होंने ट्वीट करके सबसे अपील की है कि इस वक्त उन्हें कोई कॉल या मैसेज ना करें। उन्होंने लिखा, &lsquo;प्रिय पत्रकारों, पत्रकारों, टीवी चैनलों, यह एक बहुत ही व्यक्तिगत नुकसान है। मुझे अकेला और व्याकुल छोड़ दिया है। दूर करने के लिए मुझे समय लगेगा। कृपया मुझे कॉल / मैसेज न करें। आप मेरे तनाव में शामिल हो रहे हैं। मैं अभी कुछ दिन लोगों से बात नहीं कर पाऊंगा।&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dear Journalists, reporters, TV Channels, It’s a very personal loss. Has left me numb and distraught. Will take me time to overcome. Please do not call/message me. You are adding to my stress. I CAN NOT TALK FOR A FEW DAYS. Thank You. Please 🙏🏽</p>

<p>छिछोरे थी आखिरी फ़िल्म</p>
<p>सुशांत सिंह राजपूत की आखिरी फ़िल्म छिछोरे थी। ख़ास बात है कि इसमें भी तनाव और हार-जीत के बारे में बात की गई थी। फ़िल्मों को बॉक्स ऑफ़िस पर अच्छा रिस्पॉन्स मिला था। फ़िल्म ने भारत में 150 करोड़ से ज़्यादा का बिजनेस किया था। हालांकि, दिल बेचार के बाद सुशांत के किसी और नए प्रोजेक्ट के काम करने की कोई चर्चा नहीं थी। अब उनके फैंस को आखिरी फ़िल्म का बेसब्री से इंतज़ार होगा।</p>
