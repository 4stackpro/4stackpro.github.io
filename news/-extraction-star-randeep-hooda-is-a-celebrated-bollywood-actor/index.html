Netflix’s new action film, Extraction, stars Hollywood a-listers Chris Hemsworth and David Harbour. But it also features a number of notable Indian actors, including Randeep Hooda, who is a celebrated Bollywood star.</p>
<p>L-R: Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Hooda | Jasin Boland/Netflix</p>
<p>Who is Randeep Hooda and what else has he been in?</p>
<p>Hooda is an actor and equestrian who was born and raised in Haryana, India. He pursued his undergraduate and graduate studies in Melbourne, Australia while he worked a variety of odd jobs.</p>
<p>After returning to India, Hooda started modeling and then started his acting career with the 2001 film, Monsoon Wedding, in which he played the Australian-Indian bachelor, Rahul Chadha. Since then, the 43-year-old actor has been in a number of popular Bollywood films, including D, Risk, Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai, Beeba Boys, and Highway.</p>
<p>He was nominated with India’s highest film honors for his performances in six different films. Hooda won Stardust Awards for his work in Jannat 2 and Highway and picked up a Best Actor Filmfare nomination for the erotic drama, Rang Rasiya/Colours of Passion.</p>
<p>Hooda’s scenes in ‘Extraction’ are full of intense action</p>
<p>In Extraction, Hooda plays Saju, the man who tries to stop Chris Hemsworth’s character, Tyler Rake, from rescuing a kidnapped boy. The film comes from producers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo and was directed by Sam Hargraves. All three filmmakers are known for their work on Marvel Cinematic Universe movies like Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Endgame.</p>
<p>In the film, Hooda has a number of action and fight scenes opposite Hemsworth. And in an interview with News 18 Debate &amp; Interview, he noted how much of a departure Extraction is from Marvel movies in terms of action, and revealed the prep it required.</p>
<p>“The sheer scale of the film and the fact that it is also a departure from Marvel films which are more fantasy, this is a hard-core, real gritty, sweaty kind of action,” Hooda said. “And the crew involved, the kind of scale of action, details — all that required a lot more work, more prep. I was there, weeks before, doing all these fight rehearsals and going through all the guns and stuff you’re going to use.”</p>
<p>Hooda also revealed that his nonstop fist-on-fist fight scenes are far different than anything he’s done before. But he also suggested the film’s heart isn’t in the action, it’s in the emotion.</p>
<p>“The beauty about this film that differentiates it from other action films, or which adds to this film, is the fact that it is all based in emotional content,” he said. “All the action is derived from emotion, which makes the action much more appealing — and meaningful.”</p>
<p>What is ‘Extraction’ about and when does it premiere?</p>
<p>Extraction is about Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), a black market mercenary who is hired to extract and rescue Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the son of an imprisoned drug lord who is kidnapped by a rival crime syndicate. But when dealing with the underworld of traffickers and weapons dealers, Rake’s mission becomes more of a challenge than he thought.</p>
<p>The Netflix film premieres on April 24.</p>

<h3 id="randeep-hooda-on-why-he-respectfully-declined-roles-in-hollywood-before-extraction">Randeep Hooda On Why He &lsquo;Respectfully Declined&rsquo; Roles In Hollywood Before Extraction</h3>

<p>Highlights &ldquo;I felt that the character was being ridiculed,&rdquo; said Randeep</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been offered Hollywood franchise movies earlier,&rdquo; he said</p>
<p>Randeep Hooda was last seen in Love Aaj Kal</p>
<p>Randeep Hooda made his grand Hollywood debut with Netflix&rsquo;s Extraction, which features Marvel star Chris Hemsworth in the lead role. The actor, in a recent interview with India Today, revealed that he was offered several Hollywood projects in the past. However, he &ldquo;respectfully declined&rdquo; them because he felt that the characters was &ldquo;ridiculed&rdquo; or because there was a &ldquo;stereotypical portrayal of the subcontinent.&rdquo; Randeep Hooda told India Today, &ldquo;I have been offered Hollywood franchise movies earlier but I felt that the character was being ridiculed, or is a stereotypical portrayal of the subcontinent. So, I respectfully declined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Randeep, who made a miss-and-blink appearance in the trailer, talked about his character Saju ( a former special services officer) and said, &ldquo;Each actor plays a character which contributes to the film at large. We always look at it as woh usko kha gaya, when in fact we&rsquo;re both doing our jobs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Extraction opened to lukewarm reviews from film critics. In his review for NDTV, film critic Saibal Chatterjee, wrote: &ldquo;Sam Hargrave forms the film&rsquo;s core with immediacy and raw physicality, which is heightened by Hemsworth&rsquo;s muscular presence and his cracking on-screen dynamic with Randeep Hooda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Randeep Hooda is best-known for his performances in films like Jannat 2, Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai, Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster, Sultan and Kick among others. He was also seen in Imtiaz Ali&rsquo;s Love Aaj Kal, co-starring Sara Ali Khan and Kartik Aaryan.

<h3 id="bollywood-actor-randeep-hooda-breaks-barriers-in-new-hollywood-action-film-extraction-with-chris-hemsworth">Bollywood actor Randeep Hooda breaks barriers in new Hollywood action film &lsquo;Extraction&rsquo; with Chris Hemsworth</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.gulftoday.ae/-/media/gulf-today/images/articles/culture/2020/4/25/ex1.ashx?h=400&amp;w=750&amp;hash=0B70FC97935B801B7A766C84836E0EA5" alt="img">
Combo photo shows Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Hooda.</p>
<p>Randeep Hooda is glad to be the first Indian male actor doing a Hollywood action film, and the Bollywood star says it feels great to be able to break stereotypical references of Indian characters in the West.</p>
<p>Randeep will be entering Hollywood as Saju in Netflix&rsquo;s &ldquo;Extraction&rdquo;, starring Chris Hemsworth and David Harbour.</p>
<p>Randeep has stepped out of his comfort zone to make an action-packed entry in the West.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was glad to get the movie on two to three levels. I got to feature as the first Indian male actor doing action in a Hollywood film.</p>
<p>Breaking the stereotypes of IT professionals, millionaires or comic relief in a film. It was great that I was able to break that barrier,&rdquo; Randeep told IANS.</p>
<p>He continued: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done hand to hand action much. I have an action image but haven&rsquo;t done much action (on screen). So, this was a new thing.</p>
<p>It was a new territory for me as an actor, to be able to use other factors as an actor and not just drama, and to be able to use my body and to be able to learn new things.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed it&hellip; And feeling safe while doing it because they were so well prepared. I was elated and grateful that I got to do this part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the film, Saju is the one who brings Hemsworth&rsquo;s Tyler Rake on board to the extraction of his boss&rsquo; child. The character is layered, with an emotional vein adding a touch of sensitivity in the action-packed story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The layers in the part are a result of discussions, and Sam Hargrave&rsquo;s vision from discussions, ranging from mutually favourite movies and writers. And then (it was a result of) adding a universal emotional angle, which is the family.</p>
<p>It deals a lot with that, and wanting to create a difference from the point you first see this guy to the last time you see this guy. His journey was a very gratifying experience,&rdquo; Randeep said while explaining his role.</p>
<p>Originally titled &ldquo;Dhaka&rdquo;, the film revolves around Tyler Rake (essayed by Hemsworth), a fearless, black market mercenary, who embarks on the most deadly extraction of his career when he is enlisted to rescue the kidnapped son of an imprisoned international crime lord. It has been shot extensively in India, along with other places around the world.</p>

<p>It also stars Indian actors Pankaj Tripathi, Priyanshu Painyulli, and Rudraksh Jaiswal. The screenplay of the film is done by Joe Russo.</p>
<p>The film is produced by Russo Brothers (Joe and Anthony Russo), Mike Larocca, Chris Hemsworth, Eric Gitter, and Peter Schwerin. &ldquo;Extraction&rdquo; will release on Netflix on April 24.</p>
<p>Talking about bonding with Hemsworth, Randeep said: &ldquo;I grew up in Australia, where Chris is from. So, there was a lot of Australian way of talking and humour.</p>
<p>Chris has a lot of energy. He is a sweet guy. I enjoyed working with him. I think this is one of his best and finest performances, which I&rsquo;m sure people will be bowled over by.&rdquo;
