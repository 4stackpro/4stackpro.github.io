Workers not registered for UIF relief to be hit hard financially during Covid-19</p>
<p>Share this article: Share Tweet Share Share Share Email</p>
<p>Johannesburg - Workers are going to be hard hit financially by the Covid-19 outbreak because employers have not registered them for the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF). A study by the University of Johannesburg (UJ) and the Casual Workers Advice Office has found that while the government has made provisions for employees to be paid by the UIF during the lockdown, employers had not registered workers. Under the Covid-19 Temporary Employee/Employer Relief Scheme provision, the UIF will pay employers the cost of employees’ salaries for up to three months. The report was based on the analysis of 75 companies ranging from large to small-to-medium enterprises. Thirty-five of the companies analysed remain operational while 40 have ceased operating under the national lockdown. It states that companies might have in fact not registered their employees with the fund. Though the benefit for the national disaster fund is not linked to the usual UIF benefits, beneficiaries should still be registered with the UIF.</p>
<p>The report states: “High levels of employer non-compliance in registering their workers for the UIF will severely limit the relief that workers may be able to seek through no fault of their own. Companies can only apply if they have registered their workers with the fund.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, a significant number of employers are failing to register and pay their workers UIF benefits, as required by law. The 2017 annual report from the then Department of Labour found non-compliance that it uncovered through payroll audits to be as high as 28%.”</p>
<p>The report states the figure might even be higher than what the Department of Labour believes. The researchers say instead of applying for the fund, companies are instead making employees bear the economic brunt of the lockdown by forcing them to take unpaid leave or compulsory leave.</p>
<p>It also found that of the companies that are still operating because they are essential services, they are largely failing to provide basic or adequate health and safety provisions.</p>
<p>“Out of 35 companies that are still operating, 30 had not provided personal protective equipment, 29 had not undertaken measures to ensure social distancing in the workplace, 28 had not provided transport to workers and 22 had not provided hand sanitiser.”</p>
<p>The report also noted that some companies, particularly in the food and beverage and chemical sectors, produce non-essential and luxury goods and were placing the lives of workers at risk unnecessarily.</p>

<h3 id="uif-corona-payouts-27000-businesses-have-applied-for-help">UIF corona payouts: 27,000 businesses have applied for help</h3>

Some 27,000 businesses have applied for a new emergency benefit introduced by the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF).</p>
<p>The first claims as part of a new coronavirus scheme will be paid this week.</p>
<p>Companies need to register with the UIF to secure payouts for their staff.</p>
<p>For more stories, go to Business Insider&rsquo;s home page</p>
<p>By Wednesday last week, some 27,000 companies had applied for the new coronavirus benefit which will be paid out by the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF).</p>
<p>Called the Covid-19 Temporary Employee/Employer Relief Scheme (TERS), payments will start this week, a UIF spokesperson told Business Insider.</p>
<p>Businesses who can&rsquo;t afford to pay full salaries during the lockdown must apply for TERS through the UIF.</p>
<p>Companies will have to prove that they suffered a severe knock from the lockdown. If approved, the UIF will pay out money per worker for up to three months.</p>
<p>TERS payments The payouts work on the same principle as maternity benefits currently paid by the UIF. If a company can still afford to pay employees a part of their salaries, the TERS money will “top up” these payments – but employees can’t earn more than 100% of their current salaries. The amounts paid will be a percentage of an employee’s salary, according to a legislated sliding scale from 38% (highest earners) to 60% (lowest earners) The maximum you will get is R6 730 a month. The sliding scale stops at R17 702: All workers earning more than this will only get the 38% maximum benefit (R6 730). The minimum amount will not be below the minimum wage (around R3 500). Businesses must have been registered with the UIF before the crisis started to qualify for the benefits. Employers who are unable to pay the full salaries of workers during the lock down period must send an email to <a href="mailto:Covid19ters@labour.gov.za">Covid19ters@labour.gov.za</a>, and enquiries about the scheme can be made at 0800 030 007. The UIF can take up to ten business days to review applications.</p>
<p>The UIF has set aside R40 billion to pay these claims, President Cyril Ramaphosa said last week.</p>
<p>Some 1.5 million companies in South Africa pay contributions to the UIF on behalf of their workers.</p>
<p>Over recent days, some TERS applicants received messages from the UIF that they have to resubmit some of their documents after using the incorrect format.</p>
<p>But the UIF spokesperson stressed that only companies who received messages have to resubmit their documents.</p>
<p>Normal UIF claims</p>
<p>The UIF also said this weekend that those who are receiving UIF payouts for being unemployed; unable to work due to sickness; or maternity leave, will get an SMS message to confirm their unemployment status and banking details.</p>
<p>They should not visit Labour Centres during the lockdown. Claimants are supposed to submit physical proof every month that they remain unemployment. During lockdown, this will be replaced with SMS confirmation.</p>
<p>The UIF&rsquo;s electronic claims site, Ufiling.co.za, saw almost 478,000 visits last week as more people find themselves out of work in an economic shutdown. Before the national lockdown, around 50,000 people would visit the site every day.</p>
<p>The fund is now paying out R18 million a day in claims for unemployment, illness, maternity leave, or “reduced working time” (when an employer cuts an employee’s hours). This is around R3 million more than before the crisis.</p>

<h3 id="let-sars-pay-out-uif-covid-19-relief-benefits-da-says">Let Sars pay out UIF Covid-19 relief benefits, DA says</h3>

Let Sars pay out UIF Covid-19 relief benefits, DA says</p>
<p>Share this article: Share Tweet Share Share Share Email</p>
<p>Cape Town - The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Tuesday proposed that the South African Revenue Services be drafted in to pay out Temporary Employee/employer Relief Scheme (TERS) benefits during the Covid-19 crisis if the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) lacks the capacity to handle an expected flood of applications. DA labour spokesperson Michael Cardo said SARS patently had the capacity to roll out the relief because it collected the UIF contributions in the first place and it would speed up the process of getting relief to stricken workers and companies. &ldquo;In the ordinary course of events, SARS collects UIF money paid over by employers and transfers it to the UIF. SARS has the expertise and systems to pay over the Covid-19 Ters benefit to employers swiftly.&rdquo; Cardo said it was a matter of concern that it was not clear how many applications the UIF has received since South Africa&rsquo;s Covid-19 outbreak began last month and the economy was largely shut down. &ldquo;The UIF needs to communicate clearly about how many Covid-19 TERS benefit applications it has received, processed and approved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will hopefully help to ease the anxiety and desperation of many South African workers, who do not know whether they will be able to put food on the table at the end of the month.&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Cardo said media reports have quoted a figure of 27,000 applications for the Covid-19 TERS benefits but the number seemed doubtfully small given the extent to which companies had been forced to cease trading under the national lockdown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This seems like a very small number, given that over 1.5 million companies pay contributions to the UIF, that the overwhelming majority of those companies are currently shut down and many are in financial distress, and that thousands of employees are either on unpaid leave or temporarily laid off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crucially, he said, it was not clear when the UIF would begin paying out TERS benefits to those companies that have applied and when the money would flow into the pockets of workers in distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The DA reiterates its call upon the government to publish a daily dashboard of claims received, processed and paid in terms of the Covid-19 TERS benefit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The UIF has a reputation for being inefficient, and it may face insurmountable human, infrastructural and IT-resource challenges in paying over the Covid-19 Ters benefit timeously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He quoted figures showing that in 2019, the UIF paid out 817,743 claims over 12 months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of these claims, only 24,743 were made online by u-filing. During the lockdown, all UIF claims have to be processed electronically since labour centres are closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to know, very quickly, whether the UIF is up to the task of processing and disbursing monies for a high volume of Covid-19 TERS applications. If it is not, then this function should be transferred to SARS to administer with immediate effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Congress of South African Trade unions have voiced similar concerns and also favours the government calling upon SARS to help distribute benefits payouts during the health crisis.</p>
