Nyashinski live in concert, for all his fans who enjoyed it from the comfort of their homes</p>
<p>Nyashinski, as promised, entertained Kenyans with a performance on his social media channels yesternight.</p>
<p>The concert performance was a prelude to his upcoming solo album titled Lucky You.</p>
<p>Discussing his upcoming album, he said, “This album will be a dedication to my fans all over the world, so I am inviting them to tune in to the live stream on my digital pages (Facebook, Instagram and YouTube) as we also do our part to stay #TogetherApart during this time.”</p>
<p>Nyashinski isn’t the first artist to take his music online, Sauti Sol did a #togetherathome concert a few weeks ago, inviting their fans to join them on their Instagram page.</p>

<p>During the performance, he performed oldies such as “Tuendelee”, beloved new ones like “Hello” and uplifting ones like “Mungu Pekee”.</p>
<p>The album will be available on 17th April.</p>

<p>Here’s how twitter reacted to the performance.</p>
<p>Whether the performance was recorded or live, most didn’t care.</p>
<p>But whether recorded or not what difference does it make. It was a great production. Mans be like but it was recorded like they are disappointed ? — STAY HOME. STAY SAFE. GOD BLESS. (@GMONEYizME) April 8, 2020</p>
<p>In terms of performance, it’s a consensus that Nyashinski has set the bar</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already set the bar too high @RealShinski Am sure the album will be nothing less like what you did yesterday. #Respect #LuckYou #NyashinskiLive https://t.co/TnIYDGP8D7 pic.twitter.com/EfPlJe9GcM — Kennie Tush ?? (@Kennie_gb) April 9, 2020</p>
<p>Many wanted to rewatch it and relive the experience but it wasn’t to be</p>
<p>When you wake up phyched planning to replay the @RealShinski live as you make mandarin for breakfast but wapi! Kama hukuiona jana pambaneni na Hali zenu. ????#NyashinskiLive</p>
<p>GOATness.</p>
<p>Ni sawa tu Nyash wacha tujaribu kuirecreate on YouTube — Vee (@vee_kariuki) April 9, 2020</p>
<p>A concert for everyone</p>
<p>Anyone could have watched Nyashinski live concert no matter the age. It was dope ????. This is what we call class.#NyashinskiLive pic.twitter.com/9XcPFd3wmH — Muchiri Kibicho #GodProtectUs (@Gidy81635843) April 9, 2020</p>
<p>Many were impressed by the production quality of the concert</p>
<p>On a personal note, ‘Hello’ tops my list as my fav Nyash song, for now. But ebu check out the seamless transition when Nyash returns the mic ? to its stand.</p>
<p>Hii kitu ilikuwa the ultimate production, hakuna kubahatisha. #NyashinskiLive #LuckyMe pic.twitter.com/Ol3xc4UDAk — Gift Mirie Mwaura ™ (@GiftMirie) April 9, 2020</p>

<p><img src="https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/TF2010Nyashinski.jpg" alt="img">
With no concerts to attend due to government restrictions, award-winning Kenyan rapper and singer Nyashinski will treat his fans to a live concert on April 8, 2020, which will provide a peek into his upcoming solo album titled Lucky You.</p>
<p>The concert will be streamed live via his digital pages; (YouTube and Facebook- nyashinski and Instagram- @realshinski) starting from 9.30 pm for Sh20 only.</p>
<p>Dial <em>544</em>40# to watch the Lucky You pre release live show for Kshs 20. Tonight at 9:30 p.m. on my YouTube channel! — Nyashinski (@RealShinski) April 8, 2020</p>
<p>“Nyanshinsky said the album will be a dedication to his fans all over the world and that he was inviting them to tune in to the live stream on his digital pages as people also do their part to stay #TogetherApart during this time.</p>
<p>Fans can expect the album to be delivered in Nyashinski’s signature lyrical fashion, which provides a peek into the Kenyan society by addressing various social issues whilst also displaying appreciation to them for their support.</p>
<p>Lucky You will be available on all digital platforms starting April 17, 2020.</p>
<p>Nyashinski isn’t the first artiste to take his music online. High flying boy band Sauti Sol and veteran DJ Stylez are among the first artistes in the region, to take the party online following government directives for people to stay at home over the Coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>In addition, YouTube last week launched the “Stayhome#withme” campaign, a music festival that was streamed live on their platform.</p>
<p>The festival featured African artistes performing some of their hits via a YouTube livestream for their fans who are practicing social-distancing to flatten the curve of the Coronavirus infections in their communities.
