‘Aquaman’ Star Amber Heard Could Face Prison For Fake Evidence Against Johnny Depp</p>
<p>A new report reveals that Aquaman star Amber Heard could face prison time if she is found gulty of manipulating evidence against her ex-husband Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>The intense drama surrounding the legal battle between Fantastic Beasts star Johnny Depp and Aquaman star Amber Heard started when the latter claimed she was being physically and verbally abused during their short-lived marriage. Now, Depp is suing Heard for defamation over the abuse claims.</p>
<p>International Business Times reports that Heard could face up to three years in prison if she is found guilty for falsifying evidence against Depp. Heard claimed that she suffered two black eyes the night before appearing on The Late Late Show with James Corden in 2015. However in a court document, Heard’s stylist Samantha McMillen stated that the actress didn’t appear to have any bruises on her during that time:</p>
<p>“Throughout the day of December 16, 2015, I could see clearly that Amber Heard did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part of her bod.”</p>
<p>Will Amber Heard wind up in prison? Do you think she’ll still star in future Aquaman movies? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section!</p>
<p>Johnny Depp is set to reprise his role as the villainous Gellert Grindelwald in the third Fantastic Beasts movie. Meanwhile, Amber Heard is expected to return as Mera in the yet-to-be titled Aquaman sequel. For now, fans can see Heard as Mera in Aquaman. Here’s the official synopsis for the movie:</p>
<p>From Warner Bros. Pictures and director James Wan comes an acition-packed adventure that spans the vast, visually breathtaking underwater world of the seven seas, “Aquaman,” starring Jason Momoa in the title role. The film reveals the origin story of half-human, half-Atlantean Arthur Curry and takes him on the journey of his lifetime—one that will not only force him to face who he really is, but to discover if he is worthy of who he was born to be… a king.</p>
<p>Directed by James Wan, Aquaman stars Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry, Amber Heard as Mera, Willem Dafoe as Vulko, Patrick Wilson as Orm / Ocean Master, Dolph Lundgren as Nereus, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Black Manta, Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, Ludi Lin as Captain Murk, and Temuera Morrison as Tom Curry.</p>
<p>Aquaman is available on Digital HD, 4K UHD Combo Pack, Blu-ray Combo Pack, and DVD. Stay tuned for more updates regarding Aquaman, Amber Heard and Johnny Depp as we learn them.</p>

‘Avengers’ Star Chris Hemsworth Puts On Jason Momoa’s Aquaman Suit In Cool Fan Art</p>
<p>A cool concept design showcases what Avengers star Chris Hemsworth could look like as Jason Momoa’s Aquaman successor.</p>
<p>Chris Hemsworth’s Thor and Jason Momoa’s Aquaman are two comic book icons with a surprising amount of similarities. Mainly, Thor and Aquaman both have movie franchises that wouldn’t have seen the light of day 15 years ago due to how laughable the source material is. However, Thor’s big screen debut has a 77% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and earned nearly $450 million at the global box office in 2011. Though its sequel was not great, Chris Hemsworth’s God of Thunder became one of the best characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe after his appearances in Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame.</p>
<p>Likewise, Jason Momoa’s Aquaman movie was a colossal hit for Warner Bros and DC Films. It has a 65% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and is the highest-grossing DC Comics movie of all-time with $1.148 billion. While Chris Hemsworth’s Thor looks fairly similar to his comic book counterpart, Jason Momoa’s Aquaman does not due to his tattoos, as well as his distinctive long dark hair and beard. In the comics, Aquaman is usually white with blond hair and a clean-shaved look, but Zack Snyder decided to go against the grain when he cast Momoa as his Arthur Curry for the DC Extended Universe. Digital artist jscomicart recently shared a cool fan edit that reveals just what Avengers star Chris Hemsworth could look like wearing Jason Momoa’s Aquaman suit. You can check out the edit below.</p>
<p>What do you think? Would you have liked to see Avengers star Chris Hemsworth as Aquaman? What did you think of Jason Momoa’s Aquaman movie? Let us know in the comments!</p>
<p>Chris Hemsworth will return as the God of Thunder in the fourth installment of the Thor film series. Directed by Taika Waititi, Thor: Love and Thunder will also star Tessa Thompson and Natalie Portman. The film will be based on Jason Aaron’s Mighty Thor comic book run, with Portman’s Jane Foster set to become the new Thor.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jason Momoa is set to reprise his role as Arthur Curry in Warner Bros. and DC’s yet-to-be titled Aquaman sequel. David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick is working on the script for Aquaman 2, with James Wan expected to return to the director’s chair.</p>
