As the novel coronavirus spread across the globe, the business landscape was forced to make a number of swift changes.</p>
<p>Lockdowns and social isolation measures, restricted travel, and the closure of firms not considered to be &ldquo;essential&rdquo; services proved to be a catalyst for home working, of which many of us were woefully unprepared to accommodate.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there are 1.9 million coronavirus cases worldwide. The United States, Spain, Italy, and France are the hardest hit.</p>
<p>Stringent measures that prevent employees from going into offices have required many companies, large and small, to adopt remote and virtual alternatives to stop operations from grinding to a complete halt.</p>
<p>Email and the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) aren&rsquo;t enough; workers and management need to be able to hold meetings, too.</p>
<p>There is a range of virtual conference solutions out there, including Skype, Microsoft Teams, BlueJeans, and GoToMeeting. (ZDNet&rsquo;s top enterprise picks can be accessed here).</p>
<p>Enter Zoom.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago &ndash; although it may seem like a lifetime &ndash; Zoom was not a well-known virtual conference option in the enterprise space. Almost overnight, however, it seemed everyone had adopted the platform as the go-to option to hold lessons, business meetings, and sensitive discussions.</p>
<p>Over 2020, the company has added 2.2 million new monthly users, outstripping the entire 2019 new user base of 1.19 million.</p>
<p>Zoom&rsquo;s explosive surge in popularity, however, has created security ramifications. You could almost feel sorry for the company &ndash; with its unexpected growth, the spotlight has also been shone on Zoom&rsquo;s security practices, some of which have fallen short of modern expectations.</p>
<p>CNET: Jobless after coronavirus layoffs, then struck by identity theft</p>
<p>In July 2019, a researcher disclosed a severe security issue in which Zoom opened up webcams to persistent spying and compromise; a bug that stayed in place even if the software was uninstalled due to a leftover local web server.</p>
<p>Now, more issues have been uncovered, including security flaws in the Windows 10 build of the platform&rsquo;s software, iPhone user data being sent to Facebook whether or not they had an account with the social media network, and a bug in URL generation that permitted attackers to eavesdrop on private conferences.</p>
<p>Zoom has also acknowledged that the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;end to end encryption&rdquo; marketing practices masked the truth. AES-256 encryption was meant to be implemented to keep video calls secure, but instead, a substandard AES-128 key in ECB mode was actually in use. Encryption remains a sticking point that the company insists it is working on.</p>
<p>Google, SpaceX, the New York City Department of Education, the Taiwanese, Australian, and German governments, to name but a few agencies, have banned employees from using the software until Zoom&rsquo;s security posture improves.</p>
<p>TechRepublic: The end of passwords: Industry experts explore the possibilities and challenges</p>
<p>Zoom has tried to clean up its act, and quickly. To try and prevent Zoom-bombing &ndash; the hijack of meetings and a practice the US Department of Justice recently deemed a crime &ndash; meeting ID numbers will no longer be shown in address bars.</p>
<p>A dedicated security tab has also been introduced to streamline the process of changing security settings for hosts and meeting attendees.</p>
<p>Zoom has also promised an upcoming change to where data is stored. Starting April 18, paid subscribers can opt-in or out of specific data center regions. China, too, has been geofenced to stop information outside of the country from being transferred to the area.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve covered the basics and some useful tips for experienced users in a guide here. To maintain the security of your next meeting, our recommendations are below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Password protect your meetings</li>
</ol>
<p>The simplest way to prevent unwanted attendees and hijacking is to set a password for your meeting. Passwords can be set at the individual meeting, user, group, or account level for all sessions. In order to do so, first sign in with your account at the Zoom web portal. If you want to set up a password at the individual meeting level, head straight over to the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; tab and enable &ldquo;Require a password when scheduling new meetings&rdquo;, which will ensure a password will be generated when a meeting is scheduled. All participants require the password to join the meeting. Subscription holders can also choose to go into &ldquo;Group Management&rdquo; to require that everyone follows the same password practices.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Authenticate users</li>
</ol>
<p>When creating a new event, you should choose to only allow signed-in users to participate.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Join before host</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not allow others to join a meeting before you, as the host, have arrived. You can enforce this setting for a group under &ldquo;Account Settings.&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Lock down your meeting</li>
</ol>
<p>Once a session has begun, head over to the &ldquo;Manage Participants&rdquo; tab, click &ldquo;More,&rdquo; and choose to &ldquo;lock&rdquo; your meeting as soon as every expected participant has arrived. This will prevent others from joining even if meeting IDs or access details have been leaked.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Turn off participant screen sharing</li>
</ol>
<p>No-one wants to see pornographic material shared by a Zoom bomber, and so disabling the ability for meeting attendees to share their screens is worthwhile. This option can be accessed from the new &ldquo;Security&rdquo; tab in active sessions.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Use a randomly-generated ID</li>
</ol>
<p>You should not use your personal meeting ID if possible, as this could pave the way for pranksters or attackers that know it to disrupt online sessions. Instead, choose a randomly generated ID for meetings when creating a new event. In addition, you should not share your personal ID publicly.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Use waiting rooms</li>
</ol>
<p>The Waiting Room feature is a way to screen participants before they are allowed to enter a meeting. While legitimately useful for purposes including interviews or virtual office hours, this also gives hosts greater control over session security.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Avoid file sharing</li>
</ol>
<p>Be careful with the file-sharing feature of meetings, especially if users that you don&rsquo;t recognize are sending content across, as it may be malicious. Instead, share material using a trusted service such as Box or Google Drive. At the time of writing, Zoom has disabled this feature anyway due to a &ldquo;potential security vulnerability.&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Remove nuisance attendees</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find that someone is disrupting a meeting, you can kick them out under the &ldquo;Participants&rdquo; tab. Hover over the name, click &ldquo;More,&rdquo; and remove them. You can also make sure they cannot rejoin by disabling &ldquo;Allow Removed Participants to Rejoin&rdquo; under the &ldquo;Settings: Meetings - Basic&rdquo; tab.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Check for updates</li>
</ol>
<p>As security issues crop up and patches are deployed or functions are disabled, you should make sure you have the latest build. In order to check, open the desktop application, click on your profile in the top-right, and select &ldquo;Check for updates.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="is-zoom-safe-to-use-heres-what-you-need-to-know">Is Zoom safe to use? Here’s what you need to know</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4d3c8e8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5351x2809+0+14/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F73%2Fe4%2F5c76922f4d4e8ac51cdc818d0dd9%2Fap20084624086126.jpg" alt="img">
Zoom, a videoconferencing service created for corporate webinars and meetings, has grown into something more amid the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>With the number of daily users exploding from 10 million to 200 million from December to March, it has become a forum for nearly every kind of social function,including happy hours, yoga sessions, school classes, funeral services as well as Passover, Easter and (soon) Ramadan rituals.</p>
<p>But no sooner had many tried Zoom for the first time than they began to hear reasons they might want to stay away.</p>
<p>Trolls have crashed meetings, flashing porn or racist slurs on screens. Security researchers released report after report on newly discovered vulnerabilities including leaked emails and bugs that might have allowed hackers to access webcams.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Google warned employees not to use Zoom’s desktop application on their work computers “due to privacy and security vulnerabilities.” SpaceX, the U.S. Senate and New York City’s school district have enacted similar restrictions.</p>
<p>If you’re among the tens of millions of people who have become regular Zoom users in recent weeks, you may be wondering what all this means for you. Here’s a primer on some of the notable privacy and security lapses and how to keep your calls and data safe.</p>
<p>Is Zoom sending my data to Facebook?</p>
<p>A Vice investigation showed that Zoom’s app for iPhones sent data about users’ devices to Facebook, including about users who did not have Facebook accounts. The company was hit with at least two lawsuits in federal court, one by a California resident who alleges Zoom violated the state’s new Consumer Privacy Act by disclosing information to Facebook without providing consumers with adequate notice or the ability to opt out.</p>
<p>Zoom Chief Executive Eric Yuan said in a blog post March 27 that the company removed code that sent user data to Facebook in an updated version of the iOS app. The company updated its privacy policy March 29 after a swell of concern from users.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“I think Zoom wasn’t completely honest,” Electronic Frontier Foundation senior technologist Bill Budington said. “I think they are going through a lot of growing pains.”</p>
<p>How else might my information have been compromised?</p>
<p>Reports of Zoom’s vulnerabilities predate the coronavirus crisis. Last July, security researcher Jonathan Leitschuh exposed a flaw that allowed hackers to take over Mac webcams through the app. The company fixed the problem after a public interest research center filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<p>Thousands of personal Zoom videos were left viewable on the open web, including one-on-one therapy sessions, telehealth calls, and elementary school classes, the Washington Post reported. People’s names, phone numbers and intimate conversations were revealed and children’s faces and voices were exposed.</p>
<p>Experts say the company now seems to be making more serious efforts to identify and quickly patch vulnerabilities. It formed an advisory council of chief security officers from other companies and hired Alex Stamos, Facebook’s former chief security officer, as an advisor. “That’s a lot of money being thrown at the problem to improve security. That is not insubstantial,” said Leitschuh, who discovered the Mac camera vulnerability last year.</p>
<p>Are Zoom calls encrypted, and does that matter?</p>
<p>Zoom marketed its communications as protected by end-to-end encryption, which makes it, in effect, impossible for anyone, including the company itself, to spy on them. Recently, however, the Intercept revealed Zoom has been using a different type of encryption, called transport encryption, which enables the company to decode the content of calls.</p>
<p>That means the company could hypothetically be susceptible to pressure from government authorities to disclose communications, said Bill Marczak, a fellow at the Citizen Lab and a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>That doesn’t make those calls uniquely vulnerable, however. Cellphone calls and Skype calls on default settings, for example, aren’t encrypted end to end either, and it’s unlikely the average person would need this type of security. But reporters or dissidents under oppressive regimes, government officials discussing classified information or big companies that want to keep their business strategies confidential might want to use a more secure platform, Budington said.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>What information does Zoom give my boss or co-workers?</p>
<p>If you’ve been part of a long, boring webinar, you perhaps thought there would be no harm in checking your email or your Facebook feed to pass the time. So many were alarmed at the revelation of an “attention tracking” feature that allowed the meeting host to see when participants clicked away from the active Zoom window for more than 30 seconds. The company announced it had removed the feature in an April 2 blog post.</p>
<p>That’s not the only way hosts can gather information on attendees. They can also record audio and video from meetings and save a record of group chats. Some Zoom users were surprised to learn that if they use a tool that allows them to save the chat log from a call on their local devices — which many use as a way to document meeting minutes — that record will include private chats they’ve sent in addition to messages the group has sent.</p>
<p>What is ‘Zoombombing’?</p>
<p>Because Zoom is so easy to use, it has also been easy for people to exploit the app to sow mischief or chaos. “Zoombombing” is when uninvited participants interrupt or derail a meeting. Sometimes it’s harmless trolling, but often it rises to the level of harassment.</p>
<p>As USC and local school districts transitioned to online meetings , they reported getting Zoombombed with racist taunts and pornographic images. On Tuesday, Berkeley High School students were in the middle of a video conference when a man joined the Zoom meeting, exposed himself and shouted obscenities, the Mercury News reported .</p>
<p>The New York Times found scores of accounts on Instagram and on Reddit and 4Chan message boards where users coordinated to share meeting passwords and derail Zoom meetings.</p>
<p>Zoom’s default setting allowed anyone to join video calls if they had the meeting ID, which is a number 9 to 11 digits long. These meeting IDs are easy to guess — with an automated tool ( called “war-dialing” ), one could access thousands of meetings within a day by simply making a lot of guesses.</p>
<p>What are some steps I can take to make Zoom safer to use?</p>
<p>Be careful about how you share meeting IDs. Don’t post them publicly.</p>
<p>Generate a new ID for every meeting you launch using the options panel, instead of using your personal meeting ID. That way, if someone gets ahold of your personal ID, future meetings won’t be disrupted by Zoombombers.</p>
<p>You can toggle settings to ensure meeting participants need a password to access the meeting, which will further protect from disruption.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Enable Zoom’s “Waiting Room” feature, which lets meeting hosts keep would-be participants in a digital queue until they approve them to join the session. Beginning April 4 , Zoom enabled the Waiting Room feature by default, requiring additional password settings for free users. Zoom has a guide to the feature on its website.</p>
<p>You can switch off a host of features that could be abused, if needed, including private chats, file transfers and custom backgrounds. The annotation feature, for example, could allow trolls to draw offensive shapes. You can also toggle the “allow removed participants to rejoin” option. Zoom has a guide to host controls on its website.</p>
<p>Keep your desktop app up to date, so that any patches Zoom makes to security vulnerabilities are added to your device.</p>
<p>If you want to be extra careful, use Zoom only on a mobile device, such as an iPad or an Android phone, because these versions go through review in the app stores.</p>
<p>What are some alternative platforms?</p>
<p>Signal and WhatsApp communications are encrypted end to end. WhatsApp allows encrypted calls with as many as four people. This is a suitable option for highly sensitive conversations.</p>
<p>There are also other video chatting services, such as Skype, Google Hangouts, Webex from Cisco, and FaceTime on Apple devices. Microsoft also offers powerful web, audio and video conferencing tools through its Microsoft Teams platform.</p>
<p>The bottom line</p>
<p>The reality is you can’t see your friends, your classmates and maybe your co-workers right now. You can’t eat at restaurants and you definitely can’t go to bars. Zoom is one of the platforms people have ubiquitously adopted to replace these in-person interactions amid the coronavirus outbreak. And it works relatively well.</p>
<p>It’s OK to use Zoom, experts say. Just be thoughtful about what you’re using it for and observe a few precautions.

<h3 id="automated-tool-can-find-100-zoom-meeting-ids-per-hour">Automated tool can find 100 Zoom meeting IDs per hour</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FEOxiFrOMS-2eMWfLeSU0oaEoq8=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19861742/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0003.0.jpg" alt="img">
An automated tool developed by security researchers is able to find around 100 Zoom meeting IDs in an hour and information for nearly 2,400 Zoom meetings in a single day of scans, according to a new report from security expert Brian Krebs.</p>
<p>Security professional Trent Lo and members of SecKC, a Kansas City-based security meetup group, made a program called zWarDial that can automatically guess Zoom meeting IDs, which are nine to 11 digits long, and glean information about those meetings, according to the report.</p>
<p>In addition to being able to find around 100 meetings per hour, one instance of zWarDial can successfully determine a legitimate meeting ID 14 percent of the time, Lo told Krebs on Security. And as part of the nearly 2,400 upcoming or recurring Zoom meetings zWarDial found in a single day of scanning, the program extracted a meeting’s Zoom link, date and time, meeting organizer, and meeting topic, according to data Lo shared with Krebs on Security.</p>
<p>Automated Zoom conference meeting finder &lsquo;zWarDial&rsquo; discovers ~100 meetings per hour that aren&rsquo;t protected by passwords. The tool also has prompted Zoom to investigate whether its password-by-default approach might be malfunctioning https://t.co/dXNq6KUYb3 pic.twitter.com/h0vB1Cp9Tb — briankrebs (@briankrebs) April 2, 2020</p>
<p>In January, security researchers at Check Point Research said Zoom had implemented a feature that would block repeated attempts to scan for meeting IDs following their own disclosure of a way to identify valid Zoom meeting IDs. zWarDial avoids Zoom’s blocking by routing searches through Tor, Lo said to Krebs on Security.</p>
<p>However, zWarDial can’t find meetings that are password-protected, according to Lo. By default, Zoom says it password-protects new meetings, instant meetings, and meetings accessed by manually entering a meeting ID, so the fact that zWarDial is able to find around as many meeting IDs as it can suggests that many Zoom meetings still don’t have a password.</p>
<p>“Zoom strongly encourages users to implement passwords for all of their meetings to ensure uninvited users are not able to join,” Zoom said in a statement to The Verge. “Passwords for new meetings have been enabled by default since late last year, unless account owners or admins opted out. We are looking into unique edge cases to determine whether, under certain circumstances, users unaffiliated with an account owner or administrator may not have had passwords switched on by default at the time that change was made.”</p>
<p>If you want to password-protect your meetings yourself, you can do that in the Zoom app by going to the “Meetings” tab, clicking the “Edit” button under your personal meeting ID, checking the “Require meeting password” checkbox, and then entering a password to use for your meetings. The steps are similar on the mobile app.</p>
<p>Zoom usage has shot up dramatically as more people have come to rely on the video conferencing app during the COVID-19 pandemic, but that increased usage has cast a spotlight on a litany of security and privacy issues with the service.</p>
<p>For example, trolls have been able to “Zoombomb” calls, an issue with Zoom’s “Company Directory” setting could leak user emails and photos, and Zoom confirmed to The Intercept that video calls on the app aren’t end-to-end encrypted like the company claims. To help address these issues, Zoom has announced a 90-day freeze on releasing new features and will focus on fixing privacy and security issues.</p>
