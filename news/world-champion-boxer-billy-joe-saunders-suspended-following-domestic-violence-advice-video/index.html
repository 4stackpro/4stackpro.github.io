(CNN) British boxer Billy Joe Saunders has had his license suspended following a social media video in which he seemingly advocated domestic violence.</p>
<p>In the video, the world super-middleweight champion appeared to demonstrate how men could hit their partners if &ldquo;your old woman is giving you mouth&rdquo; during the coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>The video, in which Saunders used a punching bag to show how to hit a woman &ldquo;on the chin,&rdquo; has been deleted, but the British Boxing Board of Control ( BBBofC ) has since punished the 30-year-old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having considered comments made by Billy Joe Saunders on social media we have suspended his boxer&rsquo;s license pending a hearing under the Board&rsquo;s misconduct regulation, at a time and venue to be confirmed as soon as possible,&rdquo; the BBBofC said in a statement.</p>
<p>Saunders punches Marceleo Coceres during their WBO world super-middleweight fight at Staples Center in 2019.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Idiotic, unacceptable&rsquo;</p>
<p>Saunders later apologized for the video, saying in a tweet he &ldquo;would never condone domestic violence&rdquo; and revealed he has received death threats as a result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am getting a lot of hate mail wishing me dead, wishing my family and my kids dead,&rdquo; he told Talksport Monday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got another half, but I have got a daughter and if anyone did that to my daughter, I would hurt them bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saunders&rsquo; promoter Eddie Hearn said he is &ldquo;appalled&rdquo; by the video.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was so idiotic, it was so frustrating because I know Billy well,&rdquo; he also told Talksport Monday. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one step forward, four steps back with Billy Joe Saunders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unacceptable for Joe Bloggs down the street to do it. It&rsquo;s much more unacceptable for a world champion boxer to be doing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young people are watching that video. People who are in abusive relationships are watching that video. You cannot do it, it&rsquo;s unacceptable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saunders celebrates defeating Willie Munroe Jr. for the WBO world middleweight title.</p>
<p>Saunders is unbeaten in 29 fights, and held a world title in the middleweight division before moving up to super-middleweight.</p>
<p>He had been close to fighting Canelo Alvarez in May, before the spread of the coronavirus disrupted talks between the two camps.</p>
<p>Having deleted his Twitter account, the British boxer said he would donate $30,000 (£25,000) to domestic violence charities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean for anyone to get upset about it,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;There are people dying all around the world with coronavirus and I was just trying to take the heat off that a little bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It clearly hasn&rsquo;t done, my sense of humor is not everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea.&rdquo;

<h3 id="discussion-billy-joe-saunders-should-not-be-suspended-for-clear-joke">Discussion: Billy Joe Saunders should NOT be suspended for clear JOKE</h3>
<p><img src="https://1284474717.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/saunders-black-eye-2.png" alt="img">
World Boxing News</p>
<p>Billy Joe Saunders being suspended by the British Boxing Board of Control was up for discussion on this week’s Black Eye Barber Shop Show.</p>
<p>The BBBofC acted following complaints by domestic violence groups over Saunders ‘giving advice’ to men on how to deal with their wives during coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>In what was a clear joke, Saunders uploaded the video only to suffer a backlash. Around 50% negative and 50% taking the jest, in all honesty.</p>
<p>Now, with a potential sanction from the WBO over his status as the super-middleweight champion and the potential of losing millions of dollars from a Canelo fight, Richard Poxon and Anthony Crolla went over the situation with guest journalist Ade Oladipo.</p>
<p>In the video, the general consensus is the post should be taken in the context it’s presented.</p>
<p>Saunders has already suffered damage to his career and reputation of the matter. But this sort of thing is just in Billy’s nature.</p>
<p>It’s who he is and he doesn’t try to hide it.</p>
<p>One thing that is for certain is Saunders meant no malice whatsoever and would never condone domestic violence in the slightest.</p>
<p>WATCH BELOW:</p>
<p>﻿</p>
<p>Two apologies over his action have also seemingly been ignored by the powers that be.</p>
<p>“I would like to address the situation at hand. Let me firstly start by apologizing. There is no excuse for my actions,” said Saunders.</p>
<p>“It was a very, very, very bad out of taste joke. I’m a God-fearing man and I do not condone domestic violence under any circumstances.</p>
<p>“When I created the video in poor taste I never considered how people might interpret it and instead was trying to make light of the very stressful situation we have all found ourselves in and the heightened emotions of families being confined to each other’s company.</p>
<p>“It did not cross my mind about the actual reality of domestic violence and its sufferers and the second I realized it could cause upset I quickly took the video down but unfortunately the way social media works, it spread like wildfire.</p>
<p>“I can’t change that, I have and do wholeheartedly apologise.”</p>
<p>Saunders has also promised a charitable donation to a charity for abused women. According to BEBS, that really should be enough.</p>
<p>Black Eye Barber Shop Show is hosted by former world cruiserweight champion Johnny Nelson and boxing promoter Richard Poxon.</p>

<h3 id="boxer-billy-joe-saunders-instructional-video-on-how-to-fight-women-didnt-go-great-he-lost-his-license">Boxer Billy Joe Saunders’ Instructional Video On How To Fight Women Didn’t Go Great (He Lost His License)</h3>
<p><img src="https://brobible.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/gettyimages-1187055332.jpg?quality=90&amp;w=650" alt="img">
Yiiiiiiikes. I read the headline about the video before I watched it, so I figured it would go one of two ways: either Billy Joe would be offering advice on how to pacify combative, violent women without committing domestic violence. OR he was going to try to be funny. Then I watched the video, and I’m still not really sure what he was going for. I think he’s trying to be funny? Hard to tell.</p>
<p>One of the big problems here is that he’s too instructional. His advice is real boxing advice. It would be one thing if he said, “then you sweep the leg, sit on her face, and fart!” We’d all know he was joking, and some people would still get pissed but at least you’d know he wasn’t genuinely trying to teach men how to render their partners unconscious. Instead, his advice is too legitimate. I’m now equipped with the knowledge on how to beat up a woman simply because I watched this video. I didn’t want that knowledge. This is an expert boxer teaching his craft. Tough to get laughs that way.</p>
<p>I’ve long wondered if there is a way to teach a self-defense lesson for men against women. Hear me out—obviously, you’d have to target men under 5’7”. And you’d have to preface it by saying that their female assailant is a Ronda Rousey protegé or maybe a Crossfit instructor. Hell, some of these Peloton instructors could easily take me given a few key bumps of No Xplode. Could that pass? Are enough angry women maiming their littler plant-based boyfriends?</p>
<p>Billy, as someone who has missed the mark trying to be funny a thousand times, I can tell you bud—much easier to come back from if you avoid domestic violence, race, religion, physical and mental handicaps, and gender-based stereotypes. Stay away from those topics and the worst they can say is that you’re not funny. No big deal.
