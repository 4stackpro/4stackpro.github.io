<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been admitted to hospital for tests, 10 days after testing positive for coronavirus, Downing Street has said.</p>
<p>He was taken to a London hospital on Sunday evening with &ldquo;persistent symptoms&rdquo; - including a temperature.</p>
<p>It is said to be a &ldquo;precautionary step&rdquo; taken on the advice of his doctor.</p>
<p>The prime minister remains in charge of the government, but the foreign secretary is expected to chair a coronavirus meeting on Monday morning.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson is expected to stay overnight and is having what have been described as &ldquo;routine tests&rdquo;, according to BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg.</p>
<p>In a statement, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: &ldquo;On the advice of his doctor, the prime minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a precautionary step, as the prime minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive for the virus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She added: &ldquo;The prime minister thanks NHS staff for all of their incredible hard work and urges the public to continue to follow the government&rsquo;s advice to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump began a White House press briefing by sending &ldquo;our nation&rsquo;s well wishes&rdquo; for Mr Johnson&rsquo;s &ldquo;own personal fight with the virus&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All Americans are praying for him. He&rsquo;s a great friend of mine, a great gentleman and a great leader,&rdquo; Mr Trump said, adding that he was sure the prime minister would be fine because he is &ldquo;a strong person&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Labour leader Keir Starmer also wished Mr Johnson well, saying he hoped for a &ldquo;speedy recovery&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Coronavirus is straining the highest levels of government</p>
<p>The prime minister, alongside the Queen, personifies the country&rsquo;s public response to this pandemic.</p>
<p>And Boris Johnson is continuing to personally experience the unpleasant reality of the virus.</p>
<p>Downing Street officials are adamant Mr Johnson remains in charge of the government and is in contact with ministerial colleagues and civil servants.</p>
<p>But the undeniable reality is there is nothing conventional, nothing normal about this - however routine the tests are that the prime minister is receiving.</p>
<p>The coronavirus has repeatedly proven its capacity to turn the far-fetched into reality, over and over again.</p>
<p>Advisers, officials and ministerial colleagues have all been forced to self-isolate.</p>
<p>Covid-19, the illness which the virus causes, is crippling the economy, robbing us of our usual liberties - and now it is straining the personal capacity of those at the highest level of government to respond to it.</p>
<p>Dr Sarah Jarvis, a GP and broadcaster, told the BBC that Mr Johnson would be likely to have his chest X-rayed and his lungs scanned, particularly if he had been struggling for breath.</p>
<p>She said he is also likely to have an electrocardiogram to check his heart&rsquo;s function, as well as tests on his oxygen levels, white blood cell count, and liver and kidney function before he is released from hospital.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson has worked from home since it was announced that he had tested positive for coronavirus on 27 March.</p>
<p>He was last seen in public applauding the NHS and other key workers from his flat in Downing Street on Thursday evening, and chaired a coronavirus meeting remotely on Friday morning.</p>
<p>Also on Friday, the prime minister posted a Twitter video in which said he was still displaying minor symptoms.</p>
<p>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Boris Johnson posted a video message on Friday</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still have a temperature. So in accordance with government advice I must continue my self isolation until that symptom itself goes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re working clearly the whole time on our programme to beat the virus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Saturday, his pregnant partner Carrie Symonds tweeted that she has spent a week in bed with the main symptoms.</p>
<p>She said she had not been tested for the virus.</p>
<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock had also tested positive for the virus and returned from self-isolation on Thursday to host the daily Downing Street news conference.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, has also had to self-isolate after showing symptoms.</p>
<p>Last month, the prime minister&rsquo;s spokesman said if the prime minister was unwell and unable to work, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, as the first secretary of state, would stand in.</p>
<p>The news of Mr Johnson&rsquo;s admission to hospital came shortly after the Queen delivered a rallying message to the nation, saying the UK &ldquo;will succeed&rdquo; in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic.

<h3 id="uk-prime-minister-boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-for-coronavirus">UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson admitted to hospital for coronavirus</h3>
<p><img src="https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/1sFiNo7IDA1kazaIHfZj1IQUus0=/506x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bostonglobe.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BAONORR4MVAUZJB23LTF2LU6GQ.jpg" alt="img">
Johnson, 55, has been quarantined in his Downing St. residence since being diagnosed with COVID-19 on March 26 — the first known head of government to fall ill with the virus.</p>
<p>Johnson’s office said the admission to an undisclosed London hospital came on the advice of his doctor and was not an emergency. The prime minister’s Downing St. office said it was a “precautionary step” and Johnson remains in charge of the government.</p>
<p>LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted to a hospital Sunday for tests, his office said, because he is still suffering symptoms, 10 days after he was diagnosed with COVID-19.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Johnson has continued to preside at daily meetings on Britain’s response to the outbreak and has released several video messages during his 10 days in isolation.</p>
<p>In a message Friday, a flushed and red-eyed Johnson said he said he was feeling better but still had a fever.</p>
<p>The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most people, but for some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause pneumonia and lead to death.</p>
<p>Johnson has received medical advice remotely during his illness, but going to a hospital means doctors can see him in person.</p>
<p>Dr. Rupert Beale, a group leader of the cell biology of infection lab at the Francis Crick Institute for biomedical studies, said doctors would likely “be monitoring important vital signs such as oxygen saturations,” as well as performing blood tests, assessing Johnson’s organ function and possibly performing a CT scan on his chest to assess his lungs.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has been designated to take over if Johnson becomes incapacitated, is set to lead the government’s coronavirus meeting Monday.</p>
<p>Johnson’s fiancee, Carrie Symonds, 32, revealed Saturday that she spent a week in bed with coronavirus symptoms, though she wasn’t tested. Symonds, who is pregnant, said she was now “on the mend.” She has not been staying with the prime minister in Downing St. since his diagnosis.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The government said Sunday that almost 48,000 people have been confirmed to have COVID-19 in the U.K., and 4,934 have died.</p>
<p>Johnson replaced Theresa May as Conservative prime minister in July and won a resounding election victory in December on a promise to complete Britain’s exit from the European Union. But Brexit, which became official Jan. 31, has been overshadowed by the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the globe.</p>
<p>Johnson’s government was slower than those in some European countries to impose restrictions on daily life in response to the pandemic, leading his critics to accuse him of complacency. He imposed an effective nationwide lockdown March 23, but his government remains under huge pressure to boost the country’s number of hospital beds and ventilators and to expand testing for the virus.</p>
<p>London has been the center of the outbreak in the U.K., and politicians and civil servants have been hit hard. Several other members of Johnson’s government have also tested positive for the virus, including Health Secretary Matt Hancock and junior Health Minister Nadine Dorries. Both have recovered.</p>
<p>News of Johnson’s admission to hospital came an hour after Queen Elizabeth II made a rare televised address to the nation, in which she urged Britons to remain “united and resolute” in the fight against the virus.</p>
<p>“We will succeed — and that success will belong to every one of us,” the 93-year-old monarch said, drawing parallels to the struggle of World War II.</p>

<p>“We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again,’’ she said.
