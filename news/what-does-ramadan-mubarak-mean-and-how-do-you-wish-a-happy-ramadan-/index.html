Ramadan starts today (Picture: Getty Images)</p>
<p>Today marks the first day of Ramadan – the ninth month of the Islamic calendar.</p>
<p>Each year the dates vary – depending on the lunar cycle – but in 2020 Ramadan takes place from Thursday 23 April until Saturday 23 May.</p>
<p>Ramadan is a time for daytime fasting and spiritual reflection, as well as a chance to spend time with family and friends.</p>
<p>Fasting during Ramadan – which is one of the five pillars of Islam – is seen as a way to learn patience and break bad habits, as well as an opportunity become closer to God.</p>
<p>But how do you wish someone a Happy Ramadan? Here’s what to know…</p>
<p>What does ‘Ramadan Mubarak’ mean?</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to wish someone a happy Ramadan (Picture: Getty Images)</p>
<p>The most established greeting for the holy month is ‘Ramadan Mubarak’ – which translates to mean either ‘blessed Ramadan’ or ‘happy Ramadan.’</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The word ‘Ramadan’ itself comes from the Arabic root ramiḍa or ar- ramaḍ- which means ‘scorching heat’ or ‘dryness’.</p>
<p>What other greetings can be used to wish someone a Happy Ramadan?</p>
<p>Another way to greet someone during Ramadan is to say ‘Ramadan Kareem’ – which means ‘may Ramadan be generous to you.’</p>
<p>However, there is some debate as to whether this should be used during the holy month – as it asks Ramadan to be generous to the other person.</p>
<p>Ramadan Mubarak, on the other hand, offers a blessed or happy Ramadan to the person it is exchanged with.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabian scholar Sheikh Al-Uthaymeen told the Express: ‘It should be said “Ramadan Mubarak” or whatever is similar to it, because it is not Ramadan itself that gives so that it can be kareem (generous). In fact, it is Allah who placed the grace in it, and made it a special month, and a time to perform one of the pillars of Islam.’</p>
<p>There are different greetings for Ramadan (Picture: Getty Images)</p>
<p>There are a number of other greetings which can be said to those observing Ramadan – some of these include:</p>
<p>May this Ramadan be as bright as ever.</p>
<p>Wishing you all the blessings of the holy month.</p>
<p>May Allah bring you peace and happiness this Ramadan.</p>
<p>May the divine blessings of Allah protect you.</p>

<p>Four weeks of blessings to you this Ramadan, I hope you find courage and triumph over adversity.</p>
<p>Let the spirit of Ramadan remain in your heart and light up your soul from within.</p>

<h3 id="ramadan-fasting-safely-during-coronavirus-crisis">Ramadan: Fasting safely during coronavirus crisis</h3>
<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3690/production/_111886931_gettyimages-1147629349.jpg" alt="img">

<p>Millions of people around the world will be observing the &ldquo;holy month&rdquo; of Ramadan under lockdown this year.</p>
<p>Each year, many practising Muslims fast from dawn to dusk for the whole of the lunar month - either 29 or 30 days - as part of the ritual of dedicating oneself to contemplation and prayer.</p>
<p>Fasting is obligatory for all adult followers of the faith who are able to safely go without food and drink.</p>
<p>But there are some considerations when it comes to fasting during a pandemic.</p>
<p>Fighting infection takes a lot of energy, University of Sussex immunologist Dr Jenna Macciochi says.</p>
<p>And prolonged periods of not eating or drinking can weaken the immune system.</p>
<p>So it is important to make sure you get enough calories during the hours you are permitted to eat, including enough:</p>
<p>macronutrients - carbohydrates, proteins and fats</p>
<p>micronutrients, such as vitamin C and iron</p>
<p>And it is a good idea to eat a variety of food, including lots of different coloured vegetables, fruits, pulses and legumes.</p>
<p>Both under- and over-eating can affect the immune system, so you can help yourself by staying in &ldquo;energy balance&rdquo;, according to Dr Macciochi.</p>
<p>There is also some risk in becoming dehydrated, as it can affect the mucus that lines your airways and acts as a protective barrier.</p>
<p>But looking after other aspects of your health by trying to get enough sleep and exercise and de-stressing where possible can help keep your immune system functioning as it should.</p>
<p>More simply though, the best way to protect your health is preventing exposure to the virus.</p>
<p>Much of the risk can be avoided by handwashing and, for those who can, staying at home.</p>
<p>What about people with health conditions?</p>
<p>People who are ill, including those with Covid-19, are exempt from fasting.</p>
<p>And it is not recommended for people with certain long-term conditions such as diabetes with complications.</p>
<p>Diabetes UK head of care Daniel Howarth said the decision was &ldquo;absolutely a personal reflection&rdquo; but there were some precautions people with well managed conditions who wanted to fast could take, including eating slower-release carbohydrates, such as wholegrain bread and rice, and testing your blood sugar more often.</p>
<p>What about healthcare workers?</p>
<p>The Muslim Council of Britain has published guidance, saying &ldquo;healthcare staff required to provide care to Covid-19 patients, at real risk of dehydration and making clinical errors due to wearing PPE [personal protective equipment] and long shifts&rdquo; are exempt from fasting.</p>
<p>Can fasting be good for your health?</p>
<p>Although not consuming enough calories in a day can lower your immune response, the effect of fasting on the immune system is not straightforward.</p>
<p>The immune system is not one thing with an on/off switch.</p>
<p>It is a complicated series of mechanisms that have to be kept in balance.</p>
<p>Fasting releases the stress hormone cortisol, which can suppress some immune responses.</p>
<p>But there is also good evidence from studies in mice that intermittent fasting of the kind practised during Ramadan can speed up the body&rsquo;s process of regeneration, causing old cells to die and be replaced with new ones.</p>
<p>However, it is difficult to translate this evidence to humans.</p>
<p>And it is not clear how long you would have to fast to replicate the effect.</p>

Ramadan Mubarak and Ramadan Kareem: Meaning behind the greetings explained as Ramadan 2020 starts</p>
<p>Coronavirus lockdown restrictions may mean mass gatherings are restricted but Ramadan greetings will be exchanged digitally around the world</p>
<p>By David Hughes Friday, 24th April 2020, 10:09 am Updated Friday, 24th April 2020, 10:11 am</p>

<p>However, with technology allowing worshippers around the world to commemorate the holy month remotely, with seasonal greetings of &ldquo;Ramadan Mubarak&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ramadan Kareem&rdquo; exchanged digitally across the globe - but what do the phrases mean?</p>
<p>What do &lsquo;Ramadan Mubarak&rsquo; and &lsquo;Ramadan Kareem&rsquo; mean?</p>
<p>The more common of the greetings during the holy month is &ldquo;Ramadan Mubarak&rdquo;, which translates from the Arabic word meaning &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; - the phrase therefore means &ldquo;Blessed Ramadan&rdquo;, often used in the same way as wishing somebody a &ldquo;Happy Ramadan&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ramadan Kareem&rdquo; is less commonly used, but translates as &ldquo;Generous Ramadan&rdquo; - while the phrase can be used as a greeting in a similar way to &ldquo;Ramadan Mubarak&rdquo;, it can also describe Ramadan in another context.</p>
<p>Coronavirus means meeting friends and family for the daily ritual of the iftar meal will be impossible (Photo: AFP/Getty Images)</p>
<p>There is some debate around whether using &ldquo;Ramadan Kareem&rdquo; is appropriate, given that the expectation of generosity can be considered against the principles of fasting and prayer central to observing the holy month.</p>
<p>However, others argue that the greeting can appropriately refer to the generosity of acts towards others. Khaled Boudemagh, described by Gulf News as a Dubai-based language expert, said: &ldquo;Ramadan is a month of generosity, therefore wish Kareem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both &ldquo;Mubarak&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kareem&rdquo; are also given names in Arabic, which carry the same meanings as bestowed in the Ramadan greetings.</p>
<p>What is Ramadan?</p>
<p>Fasting during Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam – the fundamental rules all Muslims follow – along with the Shahadah (declaration of faith), Salat (prayer), Zakat (charity) and the Hajj pilgrimage.</p>
<p>It is when Muslims are required to spend 30 days observing fast during daylight hours, as a means of celebrating and reflecting on their faith.</p>
<p>Ramadan is based on the cycle of the moon, meaning that the dates vary (Photo: Getty Images)</p>
<p>Beyond fasting, Muslims are also encouraged to read the Quran, with the holy text recited at the Tarawih, special nightly prayers held throughout the month.</p>
<p>Ramadan is based on the cycle of the moon, meaning that the dates are different from year to year, and cannot be predicted precisely.</p>
<p>However, this year the holy month is expected to begin on the evening of Thursday 23 April, and end on Saturday 23 May.</p>
<p>Ramadan daily UK timetable</p>
<p>Both the Central London Mosque and the East London Mosque have compiled Ramadan timetables, which give worshippers in the capital all the information they need to observe the fast correctly.</p>
<p>Here are the key timings day-by-day for Fajr and Maghrib – when the fast begins and ends – in London for the Muslim holy month, dependent on exactly when Ramadan begins:</p>
<p>Ramadan timetable (Time Fast Begins, Time Fast Ends)</p>

<p>Sat 23 May: 3.06am, 9.01pm</p>
<p>Sun 24 May: 3.03am, 9.02pm</p>
<p>It should be noted that these timings only hold for the capital – because of the varying times of sunrise and sunset across the rest of the UK, there are variations depending on location.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the charity Muslim Hands has provided the following quick guide to adjust the fast timetable to apply to where you are:
