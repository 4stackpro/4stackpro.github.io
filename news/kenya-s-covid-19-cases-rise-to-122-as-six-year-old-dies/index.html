<p>The administration of Kenyatta National Hospital is isolating and testing patients and healthcare workers who were in the intensive care unit following the death of a six-year-old child from Covid-19.</p>
<p>The boy, who had chronic anaemia, succumbed to the disease on Wednesday, raising the number of people who have died of the coronavirus to four.</p>
<p>Health minister Mutahi Kagwe, in a speech read by Chief Administrative Secretary Mercy Mwangangi, said that 122 people had tested positive for Covid-19.</p>
<p>This was after another 12 people tested positive Friday from the 362 samples analysed in the preceding 24 hours.</p>
<p>Dr Patrick Amoth, the director-general of health, said the ward where the boy was admitted would be disinfected.</p>
<p>Dr Amoth stressed the need for social distancing, the directive that people should stay away from groups and from each other.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>VARYING EFFECTS</p>
<p>The hospital has not been forthcoming on the number of healthcare workers who have been asked to self-quarantine, but it is estimated that more than 10 registrars (master’s students) who had attended to the child will be asked to go into quarantine.</p>
<p>The isolation comes at a time when there are complaints by healthcare workers over the lack of protective gear to handle Covid-19.</p>
<p>Questions have also been raised about the preparedness of healthcare workers in sorting out patients with acute respiratory illnesses, such as pneumonia.</p>
<p>Those who contract Covid-19 experience the disease in different ways: one, the sub-clinical and asymptomatic, meaning those who have the virus but do not present any symptoms, and, two, those who get infected in the upper respiratory tract, who are easier to treat; then there are those that develop pneumonia, fall very sick and need assistance in breathing through ventilators.</p>
<p>Dr Amoth said healthcare workers have been trained on triage, a medical term that refers to modalities used to choose which patient to attend to first.</p>
<p>Some hospitals have decided to treat pneumonia as a potential Covid-19 until lab tests rule out the virus.</p>
<p>HIGH RISK PATIENTS</p>
<p>Covid-19 seems to have largely spared children, but nobody knows why.</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation warns that the elderly and people with a history of immunity-compromising conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes and heart problems, are more likely to experience severe cases of Covid-19.</p>
<p>A tent has been set up at the entrance to Nakuru Level Five Hospital, where patients with acute respiratory infections are triaged.</p>
<p>Dr Joseph Mburu, the Medical Superintendent at the hospital, told the Saturday Nation that a clinical officer records a patient’s history, which includes travel, and carries out physical examination.

<p>Two more patients have died of Covid-19 in Kenya.</p>
<p>Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said the patients were in Nairobi and Mombasa.</p>
<p>The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country increased to 110 after 29 more people tested positive, the CS said.</p>
<p>The new patients include 28 Kenyans and a Congolese.</p>
<p>During a briefing Thursday, the CS unveiled a new measure to curb the spread of the deadly virus. He announced that all public transport users will be required to wear face masks when travelling.</p>
<p>Mr Kagwe said plans are under way for distribution of face masks in the counties at fair prices.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The government has started hiring health workers.</p>
<p>“We have directed that hiring of 5,000 skilled health workers across the country begin immediately with the aim of completing by Wednesday next week. All hospitals will also hire an additional 1,000 within a week, bringing the total number to 6,000,” Mr Kagwe said.

<h3 id="the-latest-fifa-extends-age-limit-for-tokyo-olympics">The Latest: FIFA Extends Age Limit for Tokyo Olympics</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/16444d2/2147483647/resize/1200x%3E/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2F7c%2Fd3bcec175e9eb8fe0a3d85a5be2d04%2Fmedia%3Aaddd6aafe1604af4aa852414ebbc28b5Pirates_Phillies_Spring_Baseball_40087.jpg" alt="img">
By The Associated Press</p>
<p>The Latest on the effects of the coronavirus outbreak on sports around the world:</p>
<hr>
<p>FIFA has extended the age limit for the men’s soccer tournament at the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>FIFA says it also postponed two women’s age-group World Cups due this year, and no international games will be played in the early June dates protected for national team call-ups.</p>
<p>The amended Olympic rule retains the “players born on or after Jan. 1, 1997” standard for the Tokyo Games.</p>
<p>It means players eligible for the intended under-23 tournament in 2020 can still play in Japan at age 24 next year. Men’s soccer kicks off ahead of the July 23, 2021 opening ceremony in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The 16 teams at the Tokyo Olympics next year can also select three over-age players in their rosters. A stellar lineup includes Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Spain.</p>
<p>The decision was made on Friday by a FIFA panel of soccer officials worldwide created to address the soccer shutdown.</p>
<p>Two women’s World Cup tournaments — the Under-20s hosted by Panama and Costa Rica in August and September, and the Under-17s in India in November — are postponed.</p>
<hr>
<p>Phillies outfielder Bryce Harper is donating $500,000 to help coronavirus relief efforts in his hometown of Las Vegas and in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Harper and his wife, Kayla, are giving money to Direct Relief and Three Square in Las Vegas and Philabundance in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>“Now is the time to come together and adhere to the guidelines of medical professionals! We are wishing the best to all with our prayers during this time,” the couple said in a statement.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Sacramento Kings&rsquo; former arena and practice facility is being converted into a surge field hospital for COVID-19 and trauma care patients.</p>
<p>The arena, in suburban Natomas, was the Kings&rsquo; home from 1988 until 2016, when they moved into a downtown facility.</p>
<p>The Kings and the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services say the hospital will have approximately 360 beds along with additional hospital services.</p>
<p>The Kings are also donating 100,000 medical masks and $250,000 to community service organizations.</p>
<hr>
<p>The PGA Tour executive who oversees player activity is the first PGA Tour employee to have tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Ross Berlin, the tour’s senior vice president of player affairs, says he was self-isolating after The Players Championship was canceled when he complained of losing his sense of taste and smell. His doctor put him through a coronavirus hotline interview and told him he wasn’t a high-risk candidate without a fever or breathing difficulties.</p>
<p>Berlin says a few days later, on March 27, he had a fever. He at first was told he had pneumonia, but a test came back positive for the virus.</p>
<p>He says he called everyone with whom he has been in contact &ndash; including his barber &ndash; and is feeling better. He says doctors told him players he might have seen on March 13 shouldn’t be concerned because he’s beyond the 14-day incubation period.</p>
<p>Berlin has been in various positions with the tour since 1998, with a brief spell as Michelle Wie’s first agent. He says his wife is awaiting her test results, though she has not shown any symptoms.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Carolina Hurricanes are putting more than half of full-time staff on furlough through June 7 while taking steps they said would ensure affected employees don’t lose income amid the coronavirus pandemic that has led to the suspension of the NHL season.</p>
<p>The team announced the plan Friday with the team and PNC Arena having shut down operations last month to ensure social-distancing practices.</p>
<p>The team says the furlough applies to about 55% of full-time employees, who would be directed to access unemployment benefits through the government’s $2.2 trillion economic rescue package.</p>
<p>Furloughed employees ineligible to collect full base salaries through unemployment would receive a bonus from the organization when the furlough ends “to be made whole.”</p>
<p>Additionally, furloughed employees will keep healthcare benefits, with the team covering premium payments during that time.</p>
<p>In a statement, team president and general manager Don Waddell says the organization “remains committed to taking care of our staff as well as possible given these unprecedented circumstances.” Waddell said the plan “protects our employees from financial hardship while also mitigating the losses suffered by the company during this shutdown.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Philadelphia 76ers owners Josh Harris and David Blitzer, as well as All-Star center Joel Embiid made a combined contribution of $1.3 million to Penn Medicine.</p>
<p>The money established a funding campaign for COVID-19 antibody testing of front line health care workers. The pledge from Embiid, Harris and Blitzer was expected to help boost efforts to quickly identify health care workers who may have immunity to the virus.</p>
<p>Embiid says “we need to do everything possible to help those heroes who are putting their lives at risk to help us.” The gifts will support new experimental serology tests that detect antibodies to determine if a person has ever been infected with the virus-identifying staff and providers that might have immunity.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the major summer baseball leagues for college players has canceled its season because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Commissioner Bruce Alger of the Valley Baseball League in Virginia said the executive committee unanimously agreed the risk to players’ health would be too great.</p>
<p>The 11-team Valley League has been sanctioned by the NCAA since 1961 and began using wooden bats in 1993. It’s among dozens of leagues where college players spend their summers.</p>
<p>The Cape Cod League, generally considered the top summer league, said it had not decided whether to cancel its season. Play is scheduled to begin June 13.</p>
<hr>
<p>Major League Lacrosse has postponed the start of its season because of the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>The six-team league was scheduled to begin its 20th season on May 30.</p>
<p>In a statement, the league says “this decision was made to safeguard the health of our players, fans and staff, as well as those within our MLL communities as a result of the global pandemic.”</p>
<p>MLL has teams in Boston, Denver, Philadelphia, Long Island, New York, Annapolis, Maryland, and Fairfield, Connescticut.</p>
<p>No date has been set for the season to begin. The league says it will be guided by CDC recommendations.</p>
<hr>
<p>Company-wide layoffs by NASCAR on Friday were part of previously planned restructuring. NASCAR did not reveal the number of employees affected. NASCAR “centralized” Iowa Speedway by dismissing most of its staff to instead use the employees from Kansas Speedway. That track is roughly four hours away from Iowa Speedway. The personnel changes were planned as part of restructuring from last years’ merger of NASCAR and track operator sister company International Speedway Corp.</p>
<p>NASCAR already has issued pay-cuts to its entire organization. It last week cut executives’ salary 25%, and 20% for other employees as stock car’s sanctioning body adapts to the new coronavirus pandemic. The 38-race NASCAR schedule is the longest in sports spanning nearly 11 months and the season was suspended four races into the year. The next publicly scheduled race is May 9 at Martinsville Speedway, but Virginia is under a state-at-home order into June. NASCAR has privately floated to teams revised 2020 schedules but not announced anything about rescheduling its races.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Southeastern Conference is extending its ban on practices and organized gatherings through the end of May.</p>
<p>The ban includes team and individual practices, meetings and other gatherings &ndash; whether voluntary or required &ndash; as well as camps and coaches clinics.</p>
<p>The powerhouse league had previously announced that in-person athletics activities were suspended through April 15 because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Also Friday, the conference said virtual film review that does not include physical activity is permissible. Effective April 6, activity of this nature will be expanded to four hours a week consistent with an NCAA rule waiver and NCAA legislation, an increase from the previously permissible maximum of two hours a week.</p>
<hr>
<p>A gaming site is donating $20,000 for pandemic relief in New Jersey and giving out another $20,000 to fans who can predict the results of the NBA 2K tournament among NBA players.</p>
<p>The 16-player tournament begins Friday night and will air on ESPN. Brooklyn’s Kevin Durant is the overall No. 1 seed and opens play against No. 16 Derrick Jones Jr. of the Miami Heat in the first round.</p>
<p>The winner of the week-long tournament will receive a $100,00 donation to a coronavirus-related relief effort of their choice.</p>
<p>BetMGM has a free bracket game available on its website to all verified New Jersey and New York players. All competitors with a perfect bracket will split $20,000 in prizes.</p>
<p>If there are no perfect brackets, the prize will be split among the highest scorers.</p>
<p>BetMGM is also donating the same amount to the New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Serie A says it will consider resuming only “when health conditions permit it.”</p>
<p>The Italian league has been suspended since March 9, when the government ordered a nationwide lockdown.</p>
<p>A new government decree issued this week prevents clubs from training &ndash; even in small groups &ndash; for at least another 10 days.</p>
<p>Twelve rounds of Serie A remain, plus four games that were postponed from the weekend of Feb. 22. Also, the Italian Cup semifinals were interrupted after the first leg.</p>
<p>Following a video conference meeting of all 20 Serie A clubs on Friday, the league said “it will await the decrees from the government and place in primary consideration taking care of the athletes’ health and all people involved.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Officials say they’re working to find a new date for the Preakness Stakes, the second jewel of horse racing’s Triple Crown.</p>
<p>The Maryland Jockey Club and Stronach Group announced Friday that whenever the Preakness is run in 2020, it will go on without infield activities that had been one of the race’s biggest traditions. The Preakness was scheduled for May 16 in Baltimore.</p>
<p>The organizations say in a joint statement finding a new date for the Preakness “will take into consideration all of the recommended best practices from local and governmental health authorities to protect our community.” The Kentucky Derby was postponed from May 2 to Sept. 5. No decision has yet been made on the Belmont Stakes, which is scheduled for June 6 at Belmont Park in New York.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Lawn Tennis Association is giving up to 20 million pounds ($24 million) through grants and interest-free loans to help venues, coaches, officials, and players in Britain during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Singles players world ranked from 101 to 750 and doubles players ranked from 101 to 250 &ndash; who are not already receiving funding &ndash; are eligible for grants, and there will be increased prize money for British tour events if the tours resume. This week, Wimbledon was canceled and the tours suspended the British grass-court season.</p>
<p>Most of the focus of the LTA package is on protecting the grassroots, including continued funding for development centers and the two national academies, and supporting full-time coaches.</p>
<p>Chief executive Scott Lloyd and the executive team will take temporary pay cuts of 20%, while some staff will be furloughed next week but will be paid 80% of their salary.</p>
<hr>
<p>Atlanta Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce says team employees have been tested after exhibiting symptoms for the new coronavirus.</p>
<p>He says no players or members of the coaching staff have shown any symptoms or been tested.</p>
<p>Pierce said Friday he doesn’t know the identity of those who were tested. He said at least 18 or 19 days have passed since any members of the team would have had contact with the employees.</p>
<p>“Everyone that has been tested, the symptoms they had or reported, they do feel better,” Pierce said. He said he has “become a master of this Zoom app” while having video conferencing with players, assistants and other NBA coaches.</p>
<hr>
<p>The NFL’s Indianapolis Colts are giving season-ticket holders the option to defer April’s payment until June 15.</p>
<p>On Friday, team officials emailed letters to those with payment plans, giving them a Wednesday deadline to accept the offer.</p>
<p>The final two installments were initially due April 15 and May 15. The Colts have not announced any changes about the May payment.</p>
<p>“In light of the unique circumstances right now, we have decided to modify the payment options for members of our season ticket family on payment plans,” the letter reads in part.</p>
<p>The move comes one day after the Indiana High School Athletic Association canceled the entire spring sports season. State officials had previously announced all schools would remain closed for the rest of the academic year.</p>
<hr>
<p>Mental health experts who were supposed to be available to help American athletes at the Tokyo Olympics are being asked to start working now.</p>

<p>More than a dozen U.S. Olympic and Paralympic athletes received reassurance this week when Toyota North America announced it would extend their endorsement contracts through the rescheduled Tokyo Games in 2021.</p>
<p>The auto company and major Olympic sponsor has 17 U.S. athletes under contract. They include swimmer David Boudia, gymnast Laurie Hernandez, Paralympian Oksana Masters and sprinter Michael Norman.</p>
<p>The status of endorsement contracts is a major concern to athletes because most signed deals that were set to expire after this year’s scheduled Olympics. They have been rescheduled for 2021 and that has forced corporations to reset and rethink the structure of their deals.</p>
<p>Visa is another major sponsor and has also told its global roster of nearly 100 Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls that it will extend sponsorships through 2021.</p>

<p>The Bundesliga club says a space inside Germany’s largest soccer stadium has been made available for medical staff to examine people with virus symptoms.</p>

<p>The Tour de Suisse has been canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic, removing one of the few cycling events left on the calendar before the Tour de France is due to start.</p>

<p>The Russian anti-doping agency is preparing to freeze all testing until May to comply with new government measures shutting down work deemed non-essential.</p>
<p>RUSADA deputy CEO Margarita Pakhnotskaya tells The Associated Press that her agency is looking for possible exemptions to instructions from President Vladimir Putin for all Russians except those working in essential sectors to stay home through April 30.</p>
<p>Pakhnotskaya says in a text message that she “will check on Monday the possibility to receive special permission” from government bodies for staff to collect samples from athletes. There will be no testing this month if that isn’t granted.</p>
<p>Testing has been suspended since March 27 under a previous round of measures.</p>
<p>Isolation measures around the world have led to a sharp drop in anti-doping tests. That’s led to warnings that some athletes could take advantage of the situation. The World Anti-Doping Agency says it is trying to track gaps in testing.</p>

<p>Former marathon world record holder Wilson Kipsang was among 20 people arrested in Kenya for locking themselves in a bar and drinking alcohol in breach of a curfew imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Police say the 2012 Olympic bronze medalist was among those detained at a police station in Iten, one of Kenya’s famous high-altitude towns where distance runners train. They were in breach of a 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. The group included a local politician.</p>
<p>Kipsang, who is also a police officer, was provisionally suspended this year from track and field and charged with doping offenses that include tampering with doping samples. He has also won the New York, London and Berlin marathons.</p>
<p>Twelve athletes were arrested in Iten earlier this week for breaching Kenyan government regulations on social gatherings during the COVID-19 crisis. The runners were arrested for training in a group, which has been banned in Kenya. Training camps have been shut down and athletes must train alone.</p>
