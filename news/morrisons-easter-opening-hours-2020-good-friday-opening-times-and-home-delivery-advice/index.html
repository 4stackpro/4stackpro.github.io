MORRISONS will close its stores on Easter Sunday but shoppers will still be able to pick up food and other essentials over the rest of the bank holiday weekend.</p>
<p>The supermarket is shutting its shops on Easter Sunday, April 12, just as it did last year.</p>
<p>1 Morrisons stores will be shut on Easter Sunday but there&rsquo;ll still be time to shop over the rest of the weekend Credit: AFP or licensors</p>
<p>Morrisons has adjusted its usual hours due to the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>These opening times will remain in force over the Easter weekend.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Brits are being reminded to only visit supermarkets when they absolutely need to.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re self-isolating and can&rsquo;t leave your home, you can try and get your shopping delivered or ask a friend or family member to shop for you.</p>
<p>When is Morrisons open over the Easter weekend?</p>
<p>Morrisons&rsquo; core opening hours are typically 8am to 8pm for most of its stores.</p>
<p>In addition, it has introduced a dedicated hour, running 7am to 8am, for NHS workers to shop every Monday to Saturday.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve asked Morrisons if this shopping hour will still happen over Easter Sunday and we&rsquo;ll update this article when we know more.</p>
<p>Morrisons has almost 500 stores in the UK - use the online finder tool to find the most up-to-date opening times for your nearest shop.</p>
<p>Good Friday (April 10): Morrisons stores are usually open 8am to 8pm on Fridays</p>
<p>These hours are expected to be the same for Good Friday.</p>
<p>Easter Saturday (April 11): Shops are expected to be open under their usual hours for Easter Saturday, so 8am to 8pm.</p>
<p>Easter Sunday (April 12): Morrisons supermarkets will be closed on Easter Sunday so staff can have a well-deserved rest.</p>
<p>Easter Monday (April 13): Morrisons will be open for business again on Easter Monday.</p>
<p>Typical Monday hours are usually 8am to 8pm, and these are expected to be in operation for Easter Monday.</p>
<p>Is Morrisons delivering over the Easter weekend?</p>
<p>Most Morrisons online delivery slots have been selling out weeks in advance, so if you don&rsquo;t already have one, it&rsquo;s highly unlikely you&rsquo;ll get a slot in time for Easter.</p>
<p>When we checked today using one London postcode, the supermarket had no slots available over Easter weekend.</p>
<p>Morrisons has been getting in contact with vulnerable customers who already have a shopping account with them to try and help to secure a slot.</p>
<p>Morrisons previously told The Sun that there is no specific time when new slots are added.</p>
<p>When are the bank holiday dates for 2020?</p>
<p>Here is the full list of upcoming 2020 bank holidays in England and Wales.</p>
<p>Dates in Scotland and Northern Ireland vary.</p>
<p>Friday, April 10 (Good Friday)</p>
<p>(Good Friday) Monday, April 13 (Easter Monday)</p>
<p>(Easter Monday) Monday, May 8 (Early May Bank Holiday)</p>
<p>(Early May Bank Holiday) Monday, May 25 (Spring Bank Holiday)</p>
<p>(Spring Bank Holiday) Monday, August 31 (Summer Bank Holiday)</p>
<p>(Summer Bank Holiday) Friday, December 25 (Christmas Day)</p>
<p>(Christmas Day) Monday, December 28 (substitute Boxing Day)</p>

<h3 id="big-supermarkets-must-close-on-easter-sunday-by-law-meaning-shoppers-will-face-even-longer-queues-this-saturday">Big supermarkets must close on Easter Sunday by law meaning shoppers will face even longer queues this Saturday</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000573812869.jpg?strip=all&amp;quality=100&amp;w=1200&amp;h=800&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
SHOPPERS have been warned to expect long queues at supermarkets this bank holiday weekend as larger stores still have to close on Easter Sundays, even during lockdown.</p>
<p>Under trading laws, shops in England and Wales (there are no restrictions in Scotland) that are over 280 square metres must close their doors on Easter Sunday and Christmas Day.</p>
<p>⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news &amp; updates</p>

<p>Recent measures have seen shopper numbers in stores limited Credit: Alamy Live News</p>
<p>Normally, they can open on Sundays but only for six consecutive hours between 10am and 6pm.</p>
<p>But the department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has confirmed these rules still stand despite the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>The Sun on Sunday has called on the government to relax Sunday trading laws.</p>
<p>The plea has been supported by MPs and supermarket bosses.</p>
<p>Shoppers can only leave their homes to get food, medicine, to go to work, or to exercise once a day.</p>
<p>But with plenty of people around the country having the Good Friday and Easter Monday bank holidays off work, it could mean more people flooding to supermarkets than usual.</p>
<p>People also need to stay 2meters away from each other, further lengthening queues Credit: Alamy Live News</p>
<p>Exemptions from Sunday trading laws Shops exempt from the Sunday trading restrictions for large shops include: airport and railway station outlets</p>
<p>service station outlets</p>
<p>registered pharmacies selling only medicinal products and medical and surgical appliances</p>
<p>farms selling mainly their own produce</p>
<p>outlets wholly or mainly selling motor or bicycle supplies and accessories</p>
<p>suppliers of goods to aircraft or sea-going vessels on arrival at, or departure from, a port, harbour or airport</p>
<p>exhibition stands selling goods</p>
<p>The issue is exacerbated by some supermarkets closing early over the rest of the Easter weekend.</p>
<p>This is on top of many supermarkets already closing doors earlier than usual during lockdown so they have more time to replenish stripped shelves and clean stores.</p>
<p>Tesco, for example, started closing all of its 24-hour stores between 10pm and and 6am, while Asda shut its between 12am and 6am.</p>
<p>Many also have special opening hours for vulnerable and elderly shoppers, as well as for NHS workers, which also sees regular shoppers face more restrictions.</p>
<p>Iceland, for example, is allowing only NHS staff to shop for the final hour of trade, while Sainsbury&rsquo;s is reserving from 7.30am to 8am from Monday to Saturday for NHS workers.</p>
<p>Waitrose has warned shoppers to expect a wait this weekend Credit: AFP or licensors</p>
<p>Many supermarkets already have reduced opening hours Credit: Alamy Live News</p>
<p>This is on top of people already facing queues outside supermarkets due to new restrictions on the number of people who enter stores.</p>
<p>Sainsbury’s, Aldi and Tesco, for example, have &ldquo;banned&rdquo; couples as supermarkets enforce social distancing rules.</p>
<p>Long queues can also happen at tills as people need to ensure they keep at least 2meters away from each other, which has also resulted in fewer checkouts being open.</p>
<p>Waitrose&rsquo;s head of customer service has warned shoppers these measures could &ldquo;mean queues&rdquo; over the Easter weekend.</p>

<p>Berangere Michel, executive director of customer service, wrote in a letter to customers: &ldquo;Most of our shops in England, Wales and the Channel Islands will be closed on Easter Sunday, and open for shorter hours on Good Friday and Easter Monday (Scottish shops will open as normal).&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;We are continuing to limit the number of customers in our shops, and introducing further measures to ensure everyone keeps a safe distance once inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, that will sometimes mean queues, but these do move quickly and many of our stores are quieter after 6pm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Asda told us the number of customers in stores will be limited at any one time so social distancing can be observed but said there wasn&rsquo;t a best time to visit.</p>
<p>Sainsbury&rsquo;s told us the vast majority of supermarkets will open from 8am to 8pm on Good Friday and added that some of its local stores will also be open on Easter Sunday.</p>
<p>Aldi, Lidl, Morrisons, and Tesco. We&rsquo;ll update this story if we get a response.</p>

<p>A BEIS spokesperson added: “The existing laws on Sunday trading still apply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, we have announced we will temporarily relax competition law for the food sector to allow supermarkets to cooperate with each other to keep their shops staffed and shelves stocked.</p>
<p>“We continue to have regular conversations with the food sector and will keep measures under review.”
