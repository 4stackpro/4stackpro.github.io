SAN MARCOS, Texas — Actor and Austin native Glen Powell is remembering his close friend, fallen San Marcos Officer Justin Putnam.</p>
<p>Putnam, 31, was killed in the line of duty while responding to a domestic disturbance call in San Marcos on Saturday, April 18. Two of his fellow San Marcos Police Department officers were also critically injured.</p>
<p>On April 24, Powell took to Instagram to remember Putnam, one of his closest friends since childhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Justin was a spark of joy. He was goofy, enthusiastic, fearless and loyal. Justin loved everyone and everyone loved him; he had an ability to make everyone feel like his best friend,&rdquo; Powell wrote. &ldquo;It’s what made him a great officer. He was the type of guy you wanted to carry that badge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You can read Powell&rsquo;s full message below:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A week ago my friend, Officer Justin Putnam, was shot and killed while responding to a domestic violence call in San Marcos, Texas. He’d been one of my closest friends since I was eleven years old.</p>
<p>This past week I’ve been reflecting on our friendship, living in memories, watching old videos, and trying to sum up someone who marched alongside me in so many different chapters of my life and whose approach to life really helped define my own.</p>
<p>Justin was a spark of joy. He was goofy, enthusiastic, fearless, and loyal. Justin loved everyone and everyone loved him; he had an ability to make everyone feel like his best friend. It’s what made him a great officer. He was the type of guy you wanted to carry that badge.</p>
<p>But I can’t think of Justin without thinking of the twinkle of mischief in his eyes. He would do just about anything for a good story or to make people laugh. I always found it truly hilarious that the guy who convinced me to break more laws as a teenager became a police officer. But it made sense because he was always a protector, of his family, his friends, and to anyone who needed help. He always said that being an officer gave him such happiness because every day he could come to the rescue of someone in need.</p>
<p>These are uncertain times that highlight the things we can take for granted. But more importantly the people we can take for granted. Tomorrow isn’t promised, but today please thank the men and women putting themselves in harm’s way to ensure our safety.</p>
<p>I’ll miss you, JPut. See you on the other side.&rdquo;</p>

Glen Powell is remembering his &ldquo;enthusiastic, fearless, and loyal&rdquo; friend, Justin Putnam, a police officer who was shot and killed while responding to a domestic violence call in Texas.</p>
<p>According to a news report, Putnam and two other officers reported to a house in San Marcos, Tex. after receiving a domestic violence call on April 18. Upon entering the residence, the three officers were shot by the attacker, who then turned the gun on himself. The two other officers remain in critical condition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a few days since the incident occurred and the actor is now sharing numerous photos of himself with the young officer, along with a caption that describes the profound sadness he feels after losing his best friend. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d been one of my closest friends since I was eleven years old,&rdquo; Powell shared. &ldquo;This past week I&rsquo;ve been reflecting on our friendship, living in memories, watching old videos, and trying to sum up someone who marched alongside me in so many different chapters of my life and whose approach to life really helped define my own.&rdquo;

Glen Powell is making art as he social distances!</p>
<p>The Scream Queens actor, 31, made a Texas flag using stainless steel, patina and a blowtorch for his younger sister Leslie, who lives in L.A. — and he shared a video of his craft with PEOPLE.</p>

<p>“First, we’re going to trace our Texas star and the good part about this, it can be a little rough around the edges,” Powell says in the clip. “The more you screw up, the messier it is, almost the better it looks. Good to see the artisan nature of it — the fact that it wasn’t made by a machine, it was made by a very flawed artist.”</p>
<p>After tracing the star, Powell then sands the piece of metal down “almost like taking the dermis level off of the skin.”</p>

<p>“That’ll allow the patina to soak in and when we use the blowtorch to like burn it, it’ll allow it to oxidize and change colors more,” he says, before pulling out his blowtorch.</p>
<p>At the end of the clip, the star shows off the finished product — a rustic Texas flag made of steel.</p>
<p>“You see those patina burn marks there, some acrylic burn marks, but it’s got a lot of character,” he says. “It looks old and aged. So that is how you turn a piece of sheet metal into a beautiful Texas flag. God bless Texas.”</p>

<p>Before ending the clip, Powell gave a shout out to two organizations helping nurses and doctors working to combat the coronavirus pandemic — Flexport and Frontline Foods.</p>
<p>“While we’re staying away from the virus, which is what we should be doing, there are people that are facing it head-on,” he says. “Those are our doctors and nurses on the front lines so obviously as they’re putting their lives at risk, we should repay the favor and show our gratitude.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the release date of Top Gun: Maverick, in which Powell stars alongside Tom Cruise, was delayed to Dec. 23 due to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
