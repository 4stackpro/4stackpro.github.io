National NEWS ANALYSIS: Jacob Zuma makes an extraordinary admission to top court Former president says he would have testified in Schabir Shaik’s trial only if he had been guaranteed immunity BL PREMIUM</p>
<p>Former president Jacob Zuma’s last-ditch application to stop his corruption prosecution does not appear to pose a threat to the state’s plans to put him on trial this year but it does contain a damaging admission that may be used against him if and when he goes on trial.</p>
<p>For the first time Zuma has revealed why he chose not to testify in the trial of his former financial adviser, Schabir Shaik, who was convicted in 2005 of corrupting him with multiple payments and benefits, and facilitating a R500,000 a year bribe for him from French arms company Thales.

SA&rsquo;s most politically polarising figure Jacob Zuma turns 78</p>
<p>Share this article: Share Tweet Share Share Share Email</p>
<p>Durban - An icon to some and a polarising figure to others, former President Jacob Zuma continues to hog the headlines and divide the country two years after leaving public office. On Sunday, the fourth democratically-elected president of the country turned 78. Birthday messages and social media comments showed he is still a divisive figure. To his supporters, he is the father of radical economic transformation (RET). To his detractors, he was allegedly corrupt to the core. Evident that he is still worshipped by his supporters were the birthday messages from the likes of Jacob Zuma Foundation which hailed him as one of the greatest revolutionaries. The foundation further described Zuma as an “African Symbol, a Liberator, an inspiration and the best leader of our time.” “It’s so much joy that you have made it to this 78th Birthday mark. Your Excellency, it’s by God’s Grace that, despite all the hurdles and health challenges especially in 2019 and the past few years, you emerged stronger, with the same love and passion for the people and Umbutho Wabantu, uKhongolose. We know it was not easy but God gave you another clean bill of Health,” the foundation said in a statement.</p>
<p>His party, the ruling ANC wished him well and said he continued to serve with “humility and dedication.” It added that Zuma has served the ANC and the masses of our people with sheer determination.</p>
<p>“The ANC wishes him well on his birthday, and further asks him to remain committed to the revolution and serving the people,” the ruling party said in a statement.</p>
<p>The ANC in KZN, a structure that was once Zuma’s political pillar for years, described him as an organic intellectual and revolutionary that dedicated his life to seeing a free South Africa.</p>
<p>“Comrade Zuma has proven to be loyal member of the glorious movement, joining campaigns and addressing the masses even after he stepped down as the president. While President Zuma&rsquo;s birthday comes at a time when the country and indeed the international community is engulfed by the Covid-19 pandemic, this does not diminish its significance,” the provincial structure said.</p>
<p>Other notable birthday messages came from KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala and former eThekwini mayor, Zandile Gumede. In her message, Gumede said: “Your role, your contribution since your youthful days to our liberation and post-liberation was never a waste, it a legacy that we are proud of. We will continue to learn from your experience and that of your generation.”</p>
<p>Notably, the South African Communist Party (SACP) an alliance partner of the ANC which fervently supported Zuma&rsquo;s rise to power between 2005 and 2013, had (by Sunday afternoon) not said anything about the birthday. In the past, it used to be one of the first parties to send warm birthday wishes.</p>
<p>Also silent was the Congress of South African Trade Union (Cosatu) another alliance partner that lent its support in 2007 in Polokwane and during the early years of the nine years of Zuma’s presidency.</p>
<p>Although they supported his rise to power, Zuma’s relationship with the two soured from 2014 to an extent that they led efforts that saw him being ousted in February 2018.</p>

<h3 id="zuma-says-decisions-taken-by-the-npa-to-prosecute-him-are-irrational-and-unlawful">Zuma says decisions taken by the NPA to prosecute him are &lsquo;irrational&rsquo; and &lsquo;unlawful&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/t8BVHOB0I0LOWteWb7e2ZmVuxyUu9DPYk7KGi6YK0Wd4lGex1DwnsDdEa7Bq4U-9wWIssHFIm1VfY2lni6ia=s1000" alt="img">
Former president Jacob Zuma has argued in papers filed at the Constitutional Court that the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has made “irrational and unlawful&rsquo; decisions relating to his prosecution.</p>
<p>Zuma has approached the apex court to seek leave to appeal against a KwaZulu-Natal High Court decision to try him for prosecution.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Appeal last month dismissed Zuma’s attempts to challenge that decision without even hearing argument on the case, on the basis that his appeal bid had no reasonable prospects of success.</p>
<p>French arms manufacturer Thales has also applied to the Constitutional Court for leave to appeal against the reinstatement of corruption charges against it.</p>
<p>The company is accused of bribing Zuma two decades ago, when he was deputy president.</p>
<p>Thales is accused of agreeing to pay Zuma an annual R500,000 bribe for protection from an investigation into the controversial multibillion-rand arms deal. The alleged bribe was facilitated by Zuma&rsquo;s former financial adviser‚ Schabir Shaik.</p>
<p>In his affidavit filed at the Constitutional Court in March, Zuma has argued that the NPA had, since 2003 made “irrational and unlawful” decisions relating to his prosecution.</p>
<p>“There is ample evidence from law reports of judicial remarks made in exasperation over these decisions made at different times by the NPA.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He argued that the KwaZulu-Natal High Court had failed “dismally” to do what it had been called to do: to evaluate the conduct and decisions of the NPA.</p>
<p>“The full court was called upon to determine, in light of the mandatory constitutional and mandatory provisions governing the exercise of prosecutional powers by the NPA, whether the NPA&rsquo;s conduct was of so egregious in nature as to compromise the achievement of a trial in my prosecution,” Zuma argued.</p>
<p>Zuma argued that it was in the interests of justice that he be granted leave to appeal because he had raised constitutional issues in his application.</p>
<p>“There is a significant prospect that the constitutional issues raised will be favourably considered by this court.”</p>
<p>William Downer, a senior deputy director of public prosecutions, argued that Zuma&rsquo;s case based on the “conspiracy” theories he had set out in his application, lacked a legal foundation.</p>
<p>“That is because Mr Zuma&rsquo;s prosecution remains perfectly lawful even if it were to be politically motivated.”</p>
<p>He argued that there were no factors connected with the interests of justice that justify granting of leave to appeal despite the prospects of reasonable success.</p>
<p>Downer said the state was ready to proceed with its case against Zuma.
