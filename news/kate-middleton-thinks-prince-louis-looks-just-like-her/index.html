When Kensington Palace released pictures of Prince Louis for his second birthday Wednesday, it was easy to be distracted by the young royal’s playful spirit. His hands were covered in fingerpaint—arrayed in a rainbow, to honor NHS workers—and it seems amazing that photographer Kate Middleton was able to grab a picture in the first place. On closer look, it’s clear that Louis is growing into the spitting image of his mother, grin and all. According to People, Kate has also noticed the similarity.</p>
<p>A friend of Kate’s told the magazine that she has commented on it before. “Everyone always comments on how Louis is the spitting image of Kate,” the friend said. “She loves it and thinks it’s very sweet, she often jokes that he’s the only one of her kids who actually looks like her!”</p>
<p>The photos were taken in Norfolk, where Kate and Louis are self-isolating alongside dad Prince William and siblings Prince George, Princess Charlotte. The palace also used the opportunity to experiment with some memes. In a post on Thursday, they did their own twist on “Instagram vs. Reality,” adding an outtake that proved Louis was having a lot of fun with that fingerpaint:</p>
<p>The three Cambridge children really do look so similar that it’s practically uncanny. George and Charlotte, in particular, could have been mistaken for twins at age one, and that might be why it’s been so easy to see personality differences between them as they’ve grown up. (George is a little more reserved, and Charlotte is a firecracker.) They also looked just like their father at the same age. In the pictures of Louis released for his first birthday, he already was starting to look slightly more like his mother. Now, if you compare him to picture of young Kate, he looks that he might have her bubbly personality, too.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/KH-COMPOSITE-QUEEN.jpg?strip=all&amp;quality=100&amp;w=1200&amp;h=800&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
PRINCE Louis is celebrating his second birthday today, and the royal family have been showering the tot with birthday wishes.</p>
<p>But there was a rather awkward blunder in the Queen’s birthday message to her great-grandson.</p>

<p>The tweet shared on her official Twitter account read: “Happy Birthday to Prince Louis</p>
<p>“HRH is The Queen’s seventh great-grandchild. Today he turns two!”</p>
<p>The message, likely to have been written by a member of the Queen&rsquo;s social media team, was accompanied by the portraits taken of Louis by his mum Kate Middleton.</p>
<p>However, Hello! Magazine pointed out that the Royal Family Twitter account had made a small error in the message.</p>

<p>Prince Louis is in fact the Queen’s sixth great-grandchild with Zara and Mike Tindall’s youngest daughter Lena, her seventh.</p>
<p>Lena arrived on 18th June 2018, two months after her second cousin Prince Louis was born on April 23.</p>
<p>The Queen has a total of eight great-grandchildren with Savannah Phillips, 11, the eldest and 11-month-old Archie Harrison the youngest.</p>
<p>The Queen wasn’t the only member of the royal family to wish Prince Louis a happy birthday with Prince Charles sharing an adorable unseen photo of his grandson.</p>

<p>Louis will celebrate his birthday with parents Wills and Kate and siblings George, six, and Charlotte, four.</p>
<p>No other family or friends will be allowed to visit or join a birthday party due to lockdown rules.</p>
<p>Though the Cambridges are likely to use video call to speak to Louis&rsquo; grandparents, even though they claim Louis has a habit of hanging up.</p>

<h3 id="kate-middleton-dresses-prince-louis-in-adorable-car-jumper---and-its-9-from-sainsburys">Kate Middleton dresses Prince Louis in adorable car jumper - and it&rsquo;s £9 from Sainsbury&rsquo;s</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/fashion/royal-style/2020042488623/prince-louis-sainsburys-car-jumper/0-424-958/prince-louis-jumper-t.jpg" alt="img">
Little Prince Louis made another sweet appearance with his family on Thursday evening - as the Cambridges made a surprise cameo on BBC One&rsquo;s Big Night In! And as ever, royal fans noticed the two-year-old Prince&rsquo;s adorable outfit - did you spot the sweet car embroidery on his navy jumper? The cute knit is in fact another bargain buy from Sainsbury&rsquo;s, and luckily it&rsquo;s still available to buy!</p>
<p>Loading the player&hellip;</p>
<p>WATCH: the Cambridges clap for the NHS</p>
<p>It looks like the Duchess of Cambridge has stocked Louis&rsquo; wardrobe with affordable clothing, choosing the &lsquo;Navy Crochet Car Jumper With Peter Pan Collar&rsquo; from the supermarket&rsquo;s TU kidswear range. It costs just £9 and is made in classic cotton, with a retro-looking race car on the front.</p>

<p>In the video, Louis wore the jumper with a pair of matching navy shorts and what looks like the Trotters &lsquo;Hampton Canvas&rsquo; shoes that Prince George was also known to wear as a tot. The plimsolls cost £22 and are still available to buy online.</p>

<p>Of course, Duchess Kate was spotted in Sainsbury&rsquo;s in March, perusing the clothing aisles with George, Charlotte and Louis. Onlooker Kate Carter told HELLO! at the time: &ldquo;I noticed Charlotte first as she had the beautiful green jacket on that she wore at Christmas. Then I saw Kate, who had Louis in her arms and I thought &lsquo;Am I the only one seeing this?&rsquo; I couldn&rsquo;t believe it was happening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was just having a little bit of a walk around. They were looking at the clothes when I saw them. Charlotte was looking at the dresses, she was dead cute,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Louis wore a Sainsbury&rsquo;s shirt in his sweet birthday snaps</p>
<p>Could Kate have picked up her youngest&rsquo;s birthday outfits back then? The two-year-old also wore a bargain Sainsbury&rsquo;s shirt for his adorable new portraits, too, which were shared by the palace on Wednesday evening.</p>
