Foodstuffs supermarkets were not super-profiteering during the coronavirus lockdown, Chris Quin, chief executive of Foodstuffs North Island said.</p>
<p>Quin said some people were accusing supermarkets of growing their profits from the huge increase in demand for groceries caused by coronavirus panic-buying.</p>
<p>But, he said: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SUPPLIED Chris Quin, chief executive of Foodstuffs North Island said supermarkets knew they would be criticised over pricing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not going to come out of this as the super profiteers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Call for pricing probe as prime minister promises supermarket briefing</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the lockdown began households have found their food bills rising, with Countdown having ended &ldquo;specials&rdquo; discounting, and prices of high-demand items like bread, and some fruit and vegetables rising dramatically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s led to calls for the Government to investigate, and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who had not seen any evidence of price-gouging, will brief the nation on supermarkets at 4pm.</p>
<p>Supermarkets had expected to be accused of price-gouging at some point, said Quin, speaking from home in an online seminar organised by the Trans-Tasman Business Circle.</p>
<p>People were scared and worried, he said, but Foodstuffs, which operated New World, Four Square and Pak &lsquo;n Save supermarkets, had opted not to try to change public perception by challenging media coverage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to fix what you can&rsquo;t fix,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lot&rsquo;s of people&rsquo;s organisations have stopped dead. There are incomes that are going to dry up. There are impacts that are scary,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What they need from us more than ever is a reassurance we are going to look after value for them as much as we possibly can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Foodstuffs was focused on keeping its balance sheet strong so it could survive the crisis, Quin said, but costs had been rising.</p>
<p>Foodstuffs had been paying more overtime than Quin had seen since being involved with the business, and it had hired around 1000 people to cope with extra demand for groceries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somewhere amongst all this the cost will become clear. We haven&rsquo;t thought it for a second,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The two rules from the start of the Covid-19 crisis were the safety of staff and customers, and making sure there were goods on the shelves for shoppers, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about doing what we need to do to get New Zealand through this,&rdquo; Quin said.</p>
<p>He said profit was not among the current guiding principles for the business, but said: &ldquo;The public won&rsquo;t believe us if we stand up and say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every day he had been receiving daly &ldquo;essential items&rdquo; pricing updates from stores.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I satisfy myself at a governance level that we are not doing the wrong thing,&rdquo; Quin said.</p>
<p>He said Foodstuffs&rsquo; supermarkets were running only about 2 per cent fewer specials than before the lockdown, but said supermarkets could not run specials on items they had no stock of.</p>
<p>He said supermarket pricing had become a political issue, and criticised media for its coverage on prices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The media have only got two subjects to talk about: coronavirus and supermarkets. There&rsquo;s nothing else in the news,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The politicians go from relying on us to keep calm, to being able to score political good will by having a go at us, if the population wanted them to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apart from the enormous ramp-up in demand, there were four big trends Quin was seeing.</p>
<p>People cooking more for themselves- including buying flour and yeast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I look at our sales of flour for the last four week, a lot of people have discovered a skill they never had before,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>There had been a huge spike in demand for online shopping, and Quin expected that to become a permanent change in the way Kiwis shopped.</p>
<p>There had also been a big spike in sales of health-boosters like vitamins.</p>
<p>There had also been a big spike in the sales of cleaning and disinfecting products.

<h3 id="covid-19-coronavirus-foodstuffs-to-consult-owners-over-easter-opening-says-no-price-gouging">Covid 19 coronavirus: Foodstuffs to consult owners over Easter opening, says no price gouging</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/lLeMH3oFK8__S7cWG5UNdGb40t4=/1200x0/smart/filters:quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-syd-prod-nzme.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4LYENZDE3RC2TCB2QHKALMFCNY.jpg" alt="img">
Foodstuffs will consult its 400 owner operators this morning over whether they want to open on Good Friday and Easter Sunday.</p>
<p>Prime minister Jacinda Ardern has indicated she is keen on supermarkets opening on those days that they were traditionally not allowed to so as to give New Zealanders maximum access to food and essential supplies.</p>
<p>Foodstuffs North Island chief executive Chris Quinn told Mike Hosking on Newstalk ZB this morning that it would take the feedback from its Pak n Save, New World and Four Square owners back to government but would work with &ldquo;whatever government needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said under the new alert level four restrictions it was getting fewer people through its supermarkets because of the two-metre distancing required but people in the main were being good about it.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are seeing generally wonderful behaviour from people and people getting it and wanting to help each other,&rdquo; said Quinn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are trying to help each other as much as possible to know when we are busy to know what is going on and to come in and shop as easy as they can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he said many of the supermarkets were still catching up on stock issues caused by panic buyers ahead of the lock-down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are still in catch-up but we are starting to look better in terms of stores being full and people being able to breathe a little bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of course a lot more people are required now to do some of the normal tasks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quinn said over the last five weeks the cooperative had hired 1000 new people and it was also looking at ways to meet changing demands with the desire for delivery growing.</p>
<p>Currently, its New World stores offer delivery but Pak n Save does not.</p>
<p>Quinn hinted that could change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt people are respecting the self-isolation rules and also what makes them comfortable and would prefer more delivery.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are working hard with our technology and our operations with a number of really interesting partners as businesses change and things we used to do are stopped and capacity becomes available and it is starting to turn up as an option for our stores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he denied that specials had disappeared and said hand on heart the supermarkets were not price gouging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the things we are very focused on, from about five weeks ago this was both a medical event and an economic event and one of the things we are really clear on is New Zealanders are going through different economic outcomes of this and we need to make sure the value in our supermarkets is held.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quinn said Pak n Save remained the lowest cost supermarket.</p>
<p>At New World he said normally customers would buy about 45 per cent of their products on special but only in the last week did that drop to 40 per cent because of lower stock levels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Normally have 5000 products on promotion this week it&rsquo;s 4800 because have got a few products just not available - we don&rsquo;t put on special products we can&rsquo;t supply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said his daily reports showed the prices for an average basked of items had changed very little over the last five weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hand on heart no price gouging.&rdquo;</p>

Emergency service workers and medical personnel will be given priority at all checkouts and queues in any Foodstuffs supermarket starting today.</p>
<p>Foodstuffs owns the New World, Pak&rsquo;nSave, Four Square and Raeward Fresh stores around New Zealand.</p>
<p>Chris Quin, CEO of Foodstuffs North Island, said any emergency service worker or medical professional wearing their uniform or carrying DHB, medical centre or proper identification would be given priority to enter the store if there was a queue and would be allowed to go through the checkout line first.</p>

<p>The move comes after shoppers faced lengthy queues in the lead up to nationwide lockdown and state of emergency announced earlier this week.</p>
<p>Supplies had been hit by people stocking up, leading to a national campaign - Shop Normally - being used by supermarkets and also Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.</p>
<p>Queues at supermarkets around the country had snaked around car parks, with security and even police called into help control the crowds.</p>
<p>In some cases staff have not only been verbally abused, but also physically.</p>

<p>Quin said they realised it would be hard for emergency services and medical personnel to do their shop at a fixed time every day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our goal is to provide New Zealand&rsquo;s much needed essential personnel with the opportunity to do their shop whenever they need to and not have to wait in any line,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are making an incredible commitment to keep us safe as we unite to fight against Covid-19 and we are incredibly grateful for their service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The offer applies to all military, Civil Defence, police, fire and emergency, St John ambulance, and medical professionals, including DHB personnel, doctors and nurses.</p>

<p>Steve Anderson, CEO of Foodstuffs South Island, said emergency services and medical teams were critical in helping New Zealanders stay safe and well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re proud to be able to do our bit to make their lives easier when we know they&rsquo;ll be working long and stressful hours. They deserve priority access all day every day, and our essential working staff look forward to serving them.&rdquo;
