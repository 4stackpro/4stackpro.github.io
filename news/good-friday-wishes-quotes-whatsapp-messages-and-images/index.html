Good Friday commemorates the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. It is observed on a Friday that falls before Easter. This year the day is falling on April 10. This day is said to be a holy day for Christians, but even though the name may indicate the fact that people celebrate Good Friday, the opposite of that is true. It is a day when people remember Jesus and pray to God. Many people celebrate the day differently and according to their traditions, but the facts that they all have in common is that they all pray in their ways and ensure that there is no happiness surrounding their houses or families.</p>
<p>Brief history of Good Friday</p>
<p>Good Friday is held in honor and remembrance of Jesus&rsquo;s Crucifixion. It is held after Maundy Thursday, which recalls the Last Supper, and on the Friday before Easter Sunday. In Christianity, Jesus&rsquo; death is one of the most important segments of the Holy Bible. In dying, Christians believe Jesus took on all the sins of the world and thus it is only through his sacrifice, that they are redeemed and allowed to enter into heaven.</p>
<p>Sometimes people dress in black and maintain silence during the hours of Christ&rsquo;s suffering. The death of Jesus symbolizes the death and forgiveness for all of mankind&rsquo;s sins, with Jesus taking the ultimate sacrifice for the good of all humans.</p>
<p>How did Good Friday get its name?</p>
<p>Good Friday was not always celebrated on a Friday. According to Britannica, Jesus&rsquo; Last Supper, Death, and Resurrection were observed the night before Easter Sunday in one single commemoration. Since then, Christians commemorate Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter Sunday separately. In English-native countries, the holiday is known as &ldquo;Good Friday,&rdquo; though in Greek and German liturgy, the term translates as &ldquo;Great Friday&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sorrowful Friday,&rdquo; respectively.</p>
<p>How is Good Friday celebrated?</p>
<p>There are many ways in which Good Friday is celebrated; the common thing between all of them is that they all involve prayers. There is a mass held at the church, and many churches have the Stations of the Cross. Some people host guests as well during the afternoon where they serve tea to their peers along with buns. Some people also observe a fast or abstain from eating on this day. Many people make it a point to pray exactly at 3:00 pm as it is said that Jesus died at this time on this day. People also make it a point to reflect on the death of Jesus during the entire course of the day, which is the purpose that this day is observed.</p>

<p>Here are 20 Good Friday quotes for you and you&rsquo;re family:</p>
<p>Christmas and Easter can be subjects for poetry, but Good Friday, like Auschwitz, cannot. The reality is so horrible it is not surprising that people should have found it a stumbling block to faith.</p>
<p>The dripping blood our only drink, The bloody flesh our only food: In spite of which we like to think That we are sound, substantial flesh and blood&ndash; Again, in spite of that, we call this Friday good.</p>
<p>If Christ is God, He cannot sin, and if suffering was a sin in and by itself, He could not have suffered and died for us. However, since He took the most horrific death to redeem us, He showed us in fact that suffering and pain have great power.</p>
<p>ood Friday is not about us trying to &ldquo;get right with God.&rdquo; It is about us entering the difference between God and humanity and just touching it for a moment. Touching the shimmering sadness of humanity&rsquo;s insistence that we can be our own gods, that we can be pure and all-powerful.</p>
<p>Maybe the Good Friday story is about how God would rather die than be in our sin-accounting business anymore.</p>
<p>Easter is a time when God turned the inevitability of death into the invincibility of life.</p>
<p>Mercy, peace and love. May the grace and Lord surround and be with you on Good Friday. God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son.</p>
<p>For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.</p>
<p>Stoning prophets and erecting churches to their memory afterwards has been the way of the world through the ages. Today we worship Christ, but the Christ in the flesh we crucified.</p>
<p>No pain, no palm; no thorns, no throne; no gall, no glory; no cross, no crown.</p>
<p>Our Lord has written the promise of the resurrection, not in books alone but in every leaf in springtime.</p>
<p>To holy people the very name of Jesus is a name to feed upon, a name to transport. His name can raise the dead and transfigure and beautify the living.</p>
<p>So shall we join the disciples of our Lord, keeping faith in Him in spite of the crucifixion, and making ready, by our loyalty to Him in the days of His darkness, for the time when we shall enter into His triumph in the days of His light.</p>
<p>Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.</p>
<p>The word “Christianity” is already a misunderstanding – in reality there has been only one Christian, and he died on the Cross.</p>
<p>How is Good Friday celebrated worldwide?</p>
<p>Good Friday is meant to be a day of reflection for Christians, a day when you focus on the sacrifice made by Jesus. It is also a day of mourning for the church. People across the world celebrate Good Friday in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>Good Friday is celebrated by fasting and praying.</p>
<p>Many Church services are held in the afternoon, usually around noon or midday to 3 pm, to remember the hours when Jesus was crucified on the cross.</p>
<p>Many churches also observe the day by re-enacting the process of the cross in the rituals of stations of the cross, which depicts the final hours of Jesus&rsquo; life.</p>
<p>Many churches also participate in Veneration of the Cross, a short ceremony in which Christians kneel before the cross and affirm their faith.</p>
<p>Many countries like Italy, Spain, Malta, The Philippines, and India held parades.</p>
<p>Countries like Bermuda flies handmade kites which symbolizes the ascension of Jesus into heaven.</p>
<p>Churches in countries like Belgium and Mexico are draped in black.</p>
<p>In Jerusalem, Christians follow in Jesus&rsquo; footsteps and walk the very same path leading to the site of the crucifixion. Many who participate try to ritually bear the same weight Jesus did by carrying crosses on their backs.</p>
<p>On Good Friday every year, tens of thousands of Brits gather in London to watch a passion play depicting the crucifixion in Trafalgar Square. The 90-minute play is completely free and open to the public.</p>
<p>In Vatican City, the Pope recites the way of the cross outside the Colosseum for Catholics from all across the world. A massive cross with torches burns in the sky and believers hold their own candles.</p>

<h3 id="bishops-good-friday-message-help-lighten-the-suffering-of-everyone-hit-by-pandemic">Bishop&rsquo;s Good Friday message: Help lighten the suffering of everyone hit by pandemic</h3>
<p><img src="https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/04/10/638632.jpg" alt="img">
MIRI: Christians must reach out to help lighten the suffering of all those hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, says head of the Miri Catholic Diocese, Bishop Richard Ng.</p>
<p>In his Good Friday message to the 90,000 Catholics in the Miri Diocese, he said it is vital to extend our time, financial and material resources and personal presence to help everyone who is suffering due to the outbreak, regardless of their race and religion.</p>
<p>“Being caring and charitable, as reflected by the life of Jesus Christ, is what Christians should emulate.</p>
<p>“Good Christians make good citizens, ” he said Friday (April 10).</p>
<p>Christians throughout the country are commemorating Good Friday in a solemn atmosphere made even more profound by the restrictions on mass gatherings.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in churches everywhere having to celebrate mass without the usual crowd of parishioners.</p>
<p>Bishop Ng said though the pandemic has resulted in a lot of hardship and suffering, it presents a time for everyone to ponder and reflect on life, and more importantly to renew their relationship with God, their families and their loved ones.</p>
<p>“Good Friday marks the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ. It is a day of sorrow and atonement for sins.</p>
<p>“This suffering will culminate in Easter Sunday where we celebrate the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>“During this Covid-19 outbreak, we cannot gather for Good Friday as a big crowd.</p>
<p>“We do live-streaming of our mass via social media &hellip; this actually presents an opportunity for parishioners to have a closer personal reflection with God in their homes and turn to God for help, and to family and loved ones for solace.</p>
<p>“The harsh time we are going through can be a time for reconciliation and renewal.</p>
<p>“There are many out there who are disabled, home-bound, homeless, lonely, isolated, and those who have run out of cash and food.</p>
<p>“Reach out and help all the needy regardless of race and religion, ” said Bishop Ng.</p>
<p>Miri Catholic parishioners are distributed over 11 urban and rural parishes in a land area one-third the size of Sarawak.</p>
<p>Good Friday is a public holiday in Sarawak, as well as Sabah.</p>
<p>Bishop Ng and the priests are celebrating mass in their private chapels but this would be broadcast via social media.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s movement control order that bars mass gatherings is part of its intensive effort to stop the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Sarawak has recorded 13 deaths and more than 300 infections so far.
