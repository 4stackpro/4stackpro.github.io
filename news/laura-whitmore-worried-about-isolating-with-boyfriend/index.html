Laura Whitmore has revealed she was worried about spending a lot of time with her boyfriend, comedian Iain Stirling, during isolation.</p>
<p>Speaking on the Private Parts podcast with Jamie Laing and Francis Boulle the Bray native explained: &ldquo;At the start, I was worried, very worried. We live together, but we don&rsquo;t see a lot of each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ian is a comedian so he has a lot of late-night gigs. I get up a lot earlier than him if I am doing radio.</p>
<p>Laughing, the TV and radio presenter continued: &ldquo;What I have discovered is that I quite like my boyfriend! It’s such a huge relief as I wasn’t sure which way it was going to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I have realised is, is that my dog is a pain in the a**. He just follows me everywhere. Literally everywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boyfriend is ok, dog is a little bit of a nightmare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura Whitmore and Iain Stirling</p>
<p>She added: &ldquo;I know everybody is having a really hard time, but I am trying to see some positives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We used to do a shop in Sainsbury come home, cook dinner together and for us that was such a novelty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don’t really get to do what people might find mundane, but now we are cooking together every night and it has been really lovely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel like I really needed this time. At the beginning of the year there was a lot of travel there was a lot of pressure, there was dealing with a lot of things I didn’t get a chance to deal with because I was constantly moving.&rdquo;</p>

TELEVISION star Laura Whitmore has lent her support to a new campaign designed to raise awareness of anxiety among women in the Irish community across Britain and beyond.</p>
<p>The London-based Wicklow native will team up with her make-up artist Brooke Simons this weekend to launch the charity Darkness into Light’s (DIL) ‘show us your warpaint’ challenge through a live Instagram post.</p>
<p>Whitmore and Simons will discuss anxiety and how it affects the female population before taking on the make-up challenge, as their thousands of Instagram followers watch on.</p>
<p>A DIL spokesperson explained: “We are living in stressful and uncertain times which is having an additional strain on our mental wellbeing.</p>
<p>“As women, we are put under immense pressure, not only by ourselves but by the expectations of society.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“We are expected to be the carers and pillars within our family dynamics and, according to a study commissioned in 2019, women do more housework than men in 93 per cent of British households.</p>
<p>“Add working from home whilst home schooling the offspring and possibly ensuring grandparents are safe and well stocked in self-isolation, and we have a very anxious female population on our hands.”</p>
<p>DIL explained that their make-up challenge is designed to hep women identify anxiety and get treatment for the disorder.</p>
<p>“An estimated 264 million people worldwide have an anxiety disorder,” they explained.</p>
<p>“Women are nearly twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder in their lifetime.</p>
<p>“In order to bring attention to the plight of our female population and help women identify and get treatment for this disorder, we have organised the makeup challenge in collaboration with Laura and Brooke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The charity, which hosts an annual walk in several countries across the globe, raises awareness and funds for the suicide and self-harm prevention charity Pieta House, as well as the London charity icap.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>With their 2020 events cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, they face losing 80 per cent of their annual fundraising total this year.</p>
<p>They hope the ‘show us your warpaint’ campaign will also drive funds to the cause.</p>
<p>“On Friday, April 17, Laura will take to her Instagram Live with Brooke to talk about anxiety, the fundraising efforts of Darkness into Light and how to participate in the challenge yourself,” they explain.</p>
<p>“As Laura takes to her live make-up session with Brooke, we have recruited Irish make-up artists and women to simultaneously share their make-up talents on to their own personal social media platforms.”</p>
<p>They added: “The aim of the challenge is to &ldquo;show us your warpaint&rdquo; as make-up so often can be seen as a way for women to gain confidence, distract themselves from the mundane and gives us a boost that is somehow indescribable.</p>
<p>“We are encouraging women throughout the UK to take part by sharing their images, nominating their friends to carry on the challenge using hashtag #showusyourwarpaint and donating whatever they can to the Darkness into Light London fundraising page.</p>
<p>“We also encourage them to tag the official Darkness into Light London social media pages.”</p>

<h3 id="love-islands-laura-whitmore-speaks-out-against-playing-the-game-on-strictly-come-dancing">Love Island&rsquo;s Laura Whitmore speaks out against &lsquo;playing the game&rsquo; on Strictly Come Dancing</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/digitalspyuk.cdnds.net/16/44/1478364756-laura-giovanni.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.334xh;0,0.190xh&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
Love Island host Laura Whitmore has criticised Strictly Come Dancing for forcing her to spend long hours with her professional partner.</p>
<p>The television presenter took part in the popular BBC show back in 2016, and was paired with Giovanni Pernice. Now, while appearing on Private Parts podcast, she&rsquo;s spoken out against its insistence that contestants be &ldquo;removed from everybody&rdquo; in their regular lives during filming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I didn&rsquo;t like was having to spend 12 hours a day with this one person,&rdquo; the 34-year-old explained. &ldquo;It did not become about the dancing. I just wanted to dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not want to play the game of doing red carpets with your dance partner and stuff like that, which a lot of people thought you should be doing. I did not want to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the same chat, Whitmore, who is currently dating Love Island narrator Iain Stirling, also opened up about how surprised she is to be enjoying being in lockdown with him so much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was a bit worried about how much time we would spend together but what I have discovered is that I quite like my boyfriend. I have worked that out. It is such a relief as I was not sure which way it was going to go. What I have discovered is my dog is a pain in the ass.&rdquo;</p>
