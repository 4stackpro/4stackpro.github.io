<h3 id="canberra-rate-relief-temporary-act-chief-minister-andrew-barr-says">&ldquo;Canberra rate relief temporary, ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr says&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/fdcx/doc7agsywt991jgcago67w.jpg/r0_388_4256_2793_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg" alt="img">
news, act-politics,</p>
<p>Canberra homeowners can only expect a temporary reprieve from residential rate hikes, with Chief Minister Andrew Barr stressing the support to be offered next financial year is &ldquo;not a forever thing&rdquo;. The ACT government won&rsquo;t increase residential rates for about two thirds of homeowners next financial year, as it looks to ease hip pocket pressure on households and inject more money into the economy in the wake of the COVID-19 shutdown. Some 110,000 homeowners will see their rates drop when the government&rsquo;s $150 rebate, which will be applied to their first bill of 2020-21, is factored in. However, rates will still increase on about 36,500 properties, with homeowners in Reid, Red Hill and O&rsquo;Malley set to be slugged an extra 4 per cent next financial year. The government had said that rates would rise only between 1 and 2 per cent for about 18,000 homeowners, but that number was revised up on Wednesday morning. Mr Barr has long resisted calls to ease up on annual residential rate hikes, which is a crucial part of Labor&rsquo;s 20-year program to eventually phase out stamp duty. But speaking to reporters before delivering his annual State of the Territory address on Wednesday, Mr Barr said it was appropriate to change tack given the unfolding economic crisis. However, Mr Barr insisted the shift was only temporary, stressing that the government wasn&rsquo;t about to walk away from the reform program. He pointed out the government had accelerated one aspect of the tax reform through the waiving of stamp duty on new residential blocks - albeit just for one year. &ldquo;This is not a forever thing,&rdquo; Mr Barr said in reference to the rate relief announced on Wednesday. &ldquo;It is not sustainable to do it forever.&rdquo; Mr Barr said it was necessary for the government to increase spending to prop up the economy during the recession. But he warned that once the economy did bounce back, the government would need to start repairing the budget position. The Canberra Liberals, which have pledged to freeze residential rates for their first four years of government if they win October&rsquo;s election, were cynical about Mr Barr&rsquo;s announcement. &ldquo;Nobody is fooled by Labor&rsquo;s desperate backflip on rates, just four months out from an election,&rdquo; Mr Coe said. &ldquo;After creating this mess, this inadequate and half-hearted attempt at cleaning it up isn&rsquo;t rolling anyone. &ldquo;Labor has proven time and time again that increasing rates is in their DNA. &ldquo;Labor&rsquo;s tired and outdated philosophy is and always has been to tax people &lsquo;til they bleed but not until they die&rsquo;. It just what they do.&rdquo; Canberra Business Chamber chief executive Graham Catt, whose organisation hosted the event, welcomed the rate relief. But Mr Catt said further rates reform was needed, in particular to the &ldquo;controversial&rdquo; commercial tax regime, which he said was leading to higher rents and reduced property values across the ACT. Owners Corporation Network president Gary Petherbridge accused Mr Barr of using the COVID-19 crisis as cover to wind back an unpopular policy ahead of this year&rsquo;s election. Mr Petherbridge was disappointed that unit owners would not benefit from the same level of rate decreases as homeowners. He again called on the ACT government to release the findings of an independent review of the tax reform program, which was commissioned late last year. Mr Barr used the State of the Territory address to frame a high-level vision for the territory&rsquo;s recovery from the twin health and economic crisis sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic. He described government spending as an &ldquo;important and powerful tool&rdquo; during any downturn, arguing now wasn&rsquo;t the time to be chasing budget surpluses. But while there was a promise of rates relief, Mr Barr didn&rsquo;t use the platform to announce any new spending or infrastructure programs - much to the disappointment of the Master Builders Association of the ACT. READ MORE: Mr Barr said while the ACT still had the nation&rsquo;s lowest unemployment rate, the economic crisis had hit Canberrans hard, particularly those who were struggling prior to the pandemic. He again pointed out that women and young people would, for different reasons, be disproportionately affected by the crisis. In explaining the types of economic support rolled out to households and business during the crisis, Mr Barr said the government had recognised the &ldquo;past failings&rdquo; of previous stimulus packages and focused primarily on delivering support through automatically applied rebates. He said that meant ratepayers didn&rsquo;t have to go through &ldquo;onerous and confusing&rdquo; application processes. He claimed the Morrison&rsquo;s government&rsquo;s JobKeeper wage subsidy scheme was the &ldquo;biggest and most egregious&rdquo; example of a confusing application process. Problems associated with the application process was to blame for the counting error which caused the cost of the scheme to be revised down from $130 billion to $70 billion, he claimed. Some of the ACT government&rsquo;s support measures have required applications, including the rate rebate scheme for commercial and residential landlords. The Canberra Times this week reported the take up of both schemes had been far lower than projected.</p>

<p>The ACT government will unlock the AIS Arena doors if the Hawks want to bring NBL games to Canberra but Chief Minister Andrew Barr says the city&rsquo;s power brokers have &ldquo;higher priorities&rdquo; than bidding for basketball content. A new ownership model has seen the foundation club ditch &ldquo;Illawarra&rdquo; from its name, with the team to be known only as the Hawks as they look to expand their footprint across Canberra, regional NSW and potentially other venues. Discussions are yet to officially begin between the Hawks and ACT officials but Barr says it is unlikely the government will pour money into the club, adding they would be welcome in the capital if ticket sales support it. Crowds of 3808 and 3344 have filtered into the AIS Arena to watch the Hawks in their two appearances in Canberra over the past two seasons. The Hawks ownership group includes Australian entrepreneur and former Sydney Kings co-owner Dorry Kordahi, ex-NBA executive Bryan Colangelo and US businessman Michael Proctor. MORE SPORT &ldquo;If they wish to have a future in this region, they can, through the basketball community and sponsors get themselves into a position where that is viable,&rdquo; Barr said. &ldquo;The whole sport industry has to now adjust down its cost base and that is happening. That&rsquo;s just a reality, that TV rights aren&rsquo;t what they were, governments don&rsquo;t have the capacity to give major subsidies to sport, certainly they&rsquo;re not going to increase from the levels they&rsquo;re at at the moment. &ldquo;If they can get the business model right, I&rsquo;ve got no problem with them wanting to include the Canberra region in a broader footprint. &ldquo;But if the idea is, or suggestion is that the ACT government would buy shares in the team or invest in it, no. We&rsquo;ve got higher priorities at the moment. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re very welcome to play games at AIS Arena, and if they can make that [happen] and the ticket sales would support it, then great, that would be fantastic.&rdquo; Basketball ACT chief David Simpson and chairman Allan Yates are keen to welcome the Hawks back for a third successive season. But discussions about bringing games to the capital are unlikely to ramp up for some time with the NBL season still months away. &ldquo;Any initiative that is going to put more of a profile on the sport out in the community and in regional areas is going to be a great thing. It&rsquo;s a great opportunity,&rdquo; Simpson said. &ldquo;Anytime we can get NBL games here is a good time for us, for the sport and for the community. We would definitely welcome games in Canberra again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still very early and it&rsquo;s not something we have been involved as yet. We would welcome discussions with the new owners when the time is right. &ldquo;We had a good relationship with the previous owners and we&rsquo;re looking forward to having those sort of discussions again.&rdquo; Basketball ACT&rsquo;s focus has been geared towards opening the doors of the Belconnen Basketball Stadium again with an eye on premier competitions resuming on July 13. Juniors will follow suit on July 20, with Simpson bracing for a potential drop in player numbers amid the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic with registrations open for another eight days.</p>

news, act-politics,</p>
<p>The almost $700 million set aside for the Morrison government&rsquo;s HomeBuilder program might have been better spent helping states and territories reduce stamp duty in their jurisdictions, ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr says. In what might be seen as a veiled criticism of the contentious program, Mr Barr said governments needed to make sure the policies and reforms rolled out to assist the COVID-19 economic recovery were &ldquo;quality spends&rdquo;. Speaking at a Committee for Economic Development of Australia forum on Monday, Mr Barr said the economic rebuild was the perfect time for the Commonwealth to partner with the states and territories to embark on substantial reforms which would leave a &ldquo;lasting legacy&rdquo;. He said stamp duty reform was one example. &ldquo;What if instead of HomeBuilder, the Commonwealth had put the equivalent amount of money on the table for states and territories to reduce stamp duty?&rdquo; Mr Barr said. &ldquo;What if there was a national partnership around tax reform? That would be a quality spend at this point in time.&rdquo; The HomeBuilder program, which offers $25,000 grants to people wanting to buy a new home or carry out a renovation, was welcomed by the property sector when it was announced earlier this month. But the housing stimulus package has been panned by economists, housing advocates and federal Labor, with most critics arguing the money would be far better spent investing in new social housing. READ MORE: Mr Barr cited his government&rsquo;s public housing renewal program, and planned spending on the $500 million Canberra Hospital upgrade, new Woden CIT and light rail expansion, as the types of &ldquo;quality spend&rdquo; which would leave an &ldquo;enduring &hellip; long-term legacy from this period&rdquo;. Mr Barr sat on the forum&rsquo;s virtual panel alongside NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet and Victorian Treasurer Tim Pallas, who are leading the states-led push for sweeping tax reform in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both men are reportedly eyeing stamp duty reforms in their jurisdictions. The ACT government is nearing the mid-point in its 20-year tax reform program, which aims to ultimately phase out stamp duty in favour of higher land-based taxes. The program has proven highly contentious, in large part because the government continues to rake in hundreds of millions of dollars in stamp duty revenue in addition to the extra rates and land tax. Mr Barr told his interstate counterparts that the reform had &ldquo;not been without its political challenges&rdquo;. &ldquo;In the end it is worthwhile,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ultimately, and we have seen this through two elections in the territory [which Labor won], that people will reward good policy. I wouldn&rsquo;t still be sitting here if my community hadn&rsquo;t endorsed this reform agenda.&rdquo;</p>

Corrected 1 p.m. | It’s an unusual time for a former small-town police officer to be running for Congress, especially as a Democrat in a Kentucky district carried by President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>But Josh Hicks is trying to meet the moment. Now working as a lawyer in Lexington, the retired Marine has made the headline item on his résumé the five years he spent as a member of the Maysville Police Department at the same time when outrage about police officers killing black civilians has led to protests across the country.</p>
<p>“This is obviously a problem, and where we have broken the public trust, where the the public trust is lacking, then it’s our responsibility as law enforcement officers, or in my case, as a former law enforcement officer, to stand up and say [that] the only way to regain this trust is to prove that we’re accountable to that community, and prove that we’re dedicated to being public servants,” Hicks said in a recent interview. “And I think that is a message that’s resonating. I’ve seen it from police chiefs across the country.”</p>
<p>Hicks is the likely Democratic challenger to Republican Rep. Andy Barr in Kentucky’s 6th District, which encompasses the cities of Lexington and Richmond, as well as the state capital of Frankfort.
