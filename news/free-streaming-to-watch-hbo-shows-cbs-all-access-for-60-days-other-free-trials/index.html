Looking for free shows to watch? Streaming services are stepping up and offering more choices to people staying at home amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The biggest streaming services, including Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and Disney+, offer free trials. Others are offering more freebies for the time being to help encourage everyone to slow the spread of COVID-19 by staying on their couch and watching TV. Here’s a list of options:</p>
<p>— HBO Now (free shows unlocked)</p>
<p>HBO unlocked more than 500 hours of premium content on Friday, April 3, including every episode of acclaimed TV series “The Sopranos,” “Veep,” “Succession,” “Six Feet Under,” “The Wire,” “Ballers,” “Barry,” “Silicon Valley” and “True Blood,&rdquo; and a small handful of movies and documentaries. To get yours, get the app for HBO Now (the standalone HBO streaming service) or HBO Go (for pay-TV subscribers), and you’ll see content that is “Stream for Free: No Subscription Required.” Visit hbonow.com for more.</p>
<p>Notes: Variety reports the free content will be available for a “limited time,” so binge-watch “The Wire” quickly. (If you don’t finish your show, you’ll still be able to via HBO Max, a new streaming service for $14.99, scheduled to launch in May.) Also, note that some HBO hits like “Game of Thrones,” “Westworld” and “Euphoria” are not being offered for free at this time.</p>
<p>— CBS All-Access (free trial for 60 days)</p>
<p>Slashfilm reports CBS All-Access is now offering a two-month free trial, so you can finally check out “Star Trek: Picard,” Jordan Peele’s “The Twilight Zone” reboot, “The Good Wife” and more &ndash; including some movies and CBS broadcast shows. To get your free trial, go to cbs.com/all-access/, sign up for a CBS All-Access account, enter the promo code GIFT for a free 30-day trial. After your account is created, go to <a href="https://www.cbs.com/all-access/account/">https://www.cbs.com/all-access/account/</a> and, under “Subscription &amp; Billing” info, enter another coupon code, ENJOY, to get 30 more days for free. After the trial, fees start at $5.99 a month.</p>
<p>— Amazon Prime Video (free 30-day trial, plus SXSW Film Festival)</p>
<p>IndieWire reports the SXSW Film Festival is moving online after South By Southwest was canceled due to coronavirus. Amazon Prime Video will offer movies from filmmakers who opt in to be available for free as part of the SXSW 2020 Film Festival Collection for 10 days. (A launch date has not been announced yet, but all you’ll need is an Amazon account.) Also, if you don’t have an Amazon account, you can get a free 30-day trial at amazon.com/prime and watch shows like “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” “Jack Ryan,” “The Boys” and “The Man in the High Castle.” After the trial, Amazon Prime (which includes free shipping on most online orders) costs $8.99 a month or $119 a year.</p>
<p>— Disney+ (free 7-day trial)</p>
<p>Disney Plus is a hit with families trying to keep their kids entertained at home, and Disney has tried to help by offering more content sooner, including recent theatrical releases “Frozen 2” and “Onward.” Other titles include “The Mandalorian,” Marvel movies, all of “The Simpsons,” and a slew of films from the vault. Disney+ costs $6.99 a month, but you can get a free 7-day trial (if you haven’t already). Visit disneyplus.com for more.</p>
<p>— Netflix (free 30-day trial)</p>
<p>If you’ve never tried Netflix, you can get a free 30-day trial at netflix.com. The streaming service features thousands of movies and TV shows, including originals like “Stranger Things,” “Fuller House,” “Tiger King,” “GLOW,” “Bird Box,” “You,” “Murder Mystery,” and “Black Mirror.” After the trial, Netflix monthly fees start at $8.99 per month.</p>
<p>— Hulu (free 30-day trial)</p>
<p>If you’ve never tried Hulu, you can get a free 30-day trial at hulu.com. The streaming service features lots of binge-worthy TV shows from broadcast television, plus originals like “Castle Rock,” “High Fidelity,” “Casual,” and the Syracuse-shot “Big Time Adolescence.” After the trial, Hulu monthly fees start at $5.99 per month.</p>
<p>— Quibi (free 90-day trial)</p>
<p>The new streaming service, focusing on “quick bite&rdquo; shows for watching on mobile devices, launches April 6 with 50 original shows including a “Punk’d” reboot, “Murder House Flip,” Chrissy Teigen’s “Chrissy’s Court,” Sophie Turner’s “Survive” and Liam Hemsworth’s “Most Dangerous Game.” A 90-day free trial is currently available, and after that it costs $5 a month with ads or $8 without. Visit quibi.com.</p>
<p>— MORE</p>
<p>Other options to watch free movies and TV shows (some with ads, no trial subscription needed) include Vudu, YouTube, Crackle, IMDb TV, Tubitv, Pluto.TV, Shout! Factory TV and Hoopla (with a library card number and pin).</p>
<hr>
<p>Note: In most cases, free trials require a credit card to sign up, and you’ll have to manually cancel your subscription before the trial ends to avoid getting charged. Also, free trials may not be available if you’ve previously gotten a free trial from a streaming service.</p>

<h3 id="hbo-will-stream-500-hours-of-free-programming-including-full-seasons-of-veep-the-sopranos-silicon-valley">HBO Will Stream 500 Hours of Free Programming, Including Full Seasons of ‘Veep,’ ‘The Sopranos,’ ‘Silicon Valley’</h3>
<p><img src="https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/veep.jpg?w=1000" alt="img">
HBO is unlocking its biggest trove of free programming ever — in a goodwill gesture as people look for a diversion during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The WarnerMedia-owned premium cabler is making almost 500 hours of programming available to stream for free (without ads) for a limited time on HBO Now and HBO Go services without a subscription, starting this Friday, April 3.</p>
<p>The list of free programming includes every episode of nine HBO series: “The Sopranos,” “Veep,” “Succession,” “Six Feet Under,” “The Wire,” “Ballers,” “Barry,” “Silicon Valley” and “True Blood.”</p>
<p>Also streaming for free are 20 Warner Bros. movies in HBO’s current catalog including “Pokémon Detective Pikachu,” “The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part” and “Crazy, Stupid, Love”; and 10 HBO documentaries and docuseries including “McMillion$” and “The Case Against Adnan Syed.”</p>
<p>Notably, however, HBO megahit “Game of Thrones” is absent from the free-streaming fiesta, as are recent hits including “Westworld,” “Big Little Lies,” “Euphoria” and “Chernobyl.” All of those series have seen big viewing gains in recent weeks, per WarnerMedia, which said streaming of HBO Now was up more than 40% from March 14-24 versus the previous four-week average. (Separately, HBO provides a limited selection of single episodes from its tentpole series to watch for free.)</p>
<p>The move by HBO to put such a huge amount of original content in front of the paywall — which it’s promoting with the hashtag #StayHomeBoxOffice — effectively serves as a major sampling strategy ahead of WarnerMedia’s scheduled launch of HBO Max in May. HBO Max will include everything on HBO, plus a host of originals, library titles and licensed content — for the same $14.99 monthly price.</p>
<p>All of the programming will be available to stream without a subscription starting April 3 by downloading the HBO Now or HBO Go apps (or by visiting hbonow.com or hbogo.com), but only in the United States. The content will also be made available for free via participating U.S. distribution partners’ platforms in the next several days, according to HBO.</p>
