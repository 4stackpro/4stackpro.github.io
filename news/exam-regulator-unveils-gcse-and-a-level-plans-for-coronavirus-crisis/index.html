Pupils taking GCSEs and A-levels this summer will have their grades awarded by a combination of teacher assessment, class ranking and the past performance of their schools, the exam regulator for England has announced.</p>
<p>Ofqual, which oversees schools’ public examinations, laid out the new system to award grades after the government cancelled this summer’s exams because of the coronavirus crisis and the resulting school closures, which are likely to remain for the rest of the academic year.</p>
<p>The new system will affect around 1.5 million pupils studying for this year’s GCSEs, A-levels and AS-levels in England, as well as many in Wales. Details are still unclear for those taking BTec and vocational or technical qualifications at schools and colleges.</p>
<p>Experts have cautioned that relying on teacher assessments is likely to penalise students from disadvantaged backgrounds, according to Jo Grady, the secretary general of the University and College Union.</p>
<p>“Our primary concern is that disadvantaged students are the ones most likely to miss out. Research shows that they fare badly when it comes to predicted grades and they are less likely to be able to put life on hold and delay sitting exams, or have access to the tools required to navigate any appeals system,” Grady said.</p>
<p>Daisy Christodoulou, the director of education at the assessment organisation No More Marking, said Ofqual’s system was likely to lessen at least some potential sources of bias.</p>
<p>“We are in unprecedented times and given the impossibility of holding exams it is hard to see what else could have been done. Ofqual’s requirement for a grade and rank order seems like the best information they could require at the moment and will at least help to iron out inconsistencies between centres,” she said.</p>
<p>UK schools to be closed indefinitely and exams cancelled Read more</p>
<p>Sally Collier, the chief regulator of Ofqual, said: “We have worked closely with the teaching profession to ensure that what we are asking is both appropriate and manageable, so that everyone can have confidence in the approach.”</p>
<p>In a message to students, Collier said: “The grades you get this summer will look exactly the same as in previous years, and they will have equal status with universities, colleges and employers, to help you move forward in your lives.”</p>
<p>Hamid Patel, the chief executive of the Star Academies group, said Ofqual’s announcement was fair and involved a minimum of bureaucracy, but he raised concerns about pupils taking GCSEs a year early in year 10. Ofqual is consulting on whether they sit the exams next year instead of being awarded a grade for their work this year.</p>
<p>“Clearly we would have all wanted the examination season this summer to continue as planned,” he said. “However, that is not possible as we have a duty first and foremost to ensure the wellbeing and safety of pupils, families and staff, including saving lives.”</p>
<p>Under Ofqual’s system, schools will be asked to recommend a grade for pupils in each subject, and to “rank order” candidates within each grade, from the pupil the school is most confident about receiving that grade to the least. The assessments will be kept confidential and not shared with individual students.</p>
<p>Each candidate’s final grade will be assigned by the exam boards using a model under development by Ofqual, using the prior attainment of the year group at each school and college, each centre’s exam performance in recent years and the expected national outcomes for all pupils.</p>
<p>The regulator said schools would submit their assessments to the exam boards from 29 May, and that it hoped to publish the final grades on or before the usual mid-August results season.</p>
<p>Ofqual’s announcement left questions still to be answered, however, including how appeals against final grades will be conducted and when students will have an opportunity to “re-sit” their exams next year.</p>
<p>The regulator said it was still considering how to award grades for external candidates, those taking the exams without a formal affiliation, such as students being home-schooled.</p>
<p>Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the move was pragmatic and avoided extra burdens on schools.</p>
<p>“Of course this is not a seamless solution. Students will have been expecting to go through a very different process. However, their grades will now be determined by the professionals who know them best, professionals who are well-equipped to make these judgments, and we hope that gives students confidence that they are in safe hands,” he said.</p>
<p>Gavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, said: “Despite the difficult circumstances we are facing, this guidance provides assurance to students, parents and schools that grades awarded this summer will accurately reflect students’ abilities and will be as valid this year as any other.”

<h3 id="students-to-sit-functional-skills-english-and-maths-exams-at-home">Students to sit functional skills English and maths exams at home</h3>
<p><img src="https://feweek.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/learner-student-at-home-work-study-feat.jpg" alt="img">
Thousands of students will be able to sit their functional skills exams from home from next week, the first ever time under “game changing” plans unveiled by City &amp; Guilds.</p>
<p>The awarding giant will move from assessments at centres to remote invigilation by using online meeting software such as GoToMeeting, Zoom and Microsoft Teams during the Covid-19 crisis.</p>
<p>Newly reformed functional skills qualifications in English and maths were rolled out in September 2019 and include strict invigilation criteria.</p>
<p>Exams regulator Ofqual has however given the move from City &amp; Guilds the green light, explaining that their rules do not rule out remote or even home invigilation.</p>
<p>But they said they do require awarding organisations to satisfy themselves that the assessment arrangements used for a qualification are appropriate.</p>
<p>David Phillips, managing director at City &amp; Guild, told FE Week: “This Covid-19 crisis has helped us think very differently about learner progression and how to get them through assessments.</p>
<p>“The move to remote invigilation, where learners can securely sit the test from home will be a game changer for colleges and training providers.</p>
<p>“We have had very good and open dialogue with Ofqual and are really pleased to be able to do this from next week.”</p>
<p>Last month the government announced the cancellation of the summer exams series for A-levels and GCSEs. Students will instead be graded via teacher evidence of each student’s performance throughout their studies, including mock tests.</p>
<p>Unlike GCSE and A-levels that are typically tested in the summer, functional skills qualifications are on-demand tests, with most exam boards running a session each month.</p>
<p>A City &amp; Guilds spokesperson said the organisation will be able to “deliver remote testing of our E-volve tests on-demand at our learner’s homes.</p>
<p>“This will continue the delivery of a number of our assessments including functional skills during the Covid-19 closures.</p>
<p>“Centres will be able to remotely deliver and invigilate the online tests to learners and apprentices in their own home environment.”</p>
<p>They added that detailed guidelines and instructions will be available to centres in the week commencing 6 April.

<h3 id="coronavirus-ofqual-to-set-out-details-of-process-and-timetable-next-week">Coronavirus: Ofqual to set out details of process and timetable &lsquo;next week&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://feweek.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ofqual-new-logo-2019-feat.jpg" alt="img">
Detailed information about how students will be assessed for this summer’s GCSEs and A-levels won’t be published until next week, the exams regulator has said.</p>
<p>But schools and colleges will have to wait longer for details of how moderation and appeals will work.</p>
<p>Ofqual said it was “rapidly working up plans” to implement the arrangements announced by the government last week.</p>
<p>Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, announced last Wednesday that exams this summer would be cancelled. On Friday, the government said students would instead be assessed by their teachers. Schools and colleges have been awaiting further details since then.</p>
<p>“Students understandably want reassurance, and teachers urgently need to know what to do, and when,” said Ofqual in a statement.</p>
<p>“We expect to publish detailed information about the process and timetable which will apply this summer next week.”</p>
<p>Next week’s release will cover the steps teachers and lecturers will have to follow and “more detailed guidance on how to consider the full range of evidence they will have available when submitting their assessment grades”.</p>
<p>“We are talking to teaching representatives to make sure that what we are planning is manageable and appropriate, so that students, parents, carers and teachers can have confidence in the approach.”</p>
<p>Ofqual has also pledged to outline “by Easter” the process it will follow to make sure grades are fair across schools and colleges, as well as its proposals for appeals.</p>
<p>“We will also say more as soon as possible about the arrangements for additional exams in the new academic year,” the regulator said.</p>
<p>“We want to reassure students waiting for news that we are doing everything we can to make sure they are not disadvantaged by these unprecedented circumstances.“
