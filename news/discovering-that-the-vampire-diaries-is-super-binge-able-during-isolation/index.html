As I mentioned in my self-quarantine binge-watching recommendations, I am currently bingeing The Vampire Diaries. I am now almost at the end of season three, and guys, I HAVE to talk about this show. I know I’m years late to the party, but this show is so bonkers I cannot keep all my thoughts inside. I’ve been talking to my cat for days about this, but she has no interesting in continuing the conversation, so now I bring to you, dear readers, all my thoughts and feelings about The Vampire Diaries.</p>
<p>I don’t care about the love triangle</p>
<p>Like most teen dramas, The Vampire Diaries revolves around a love triangle. At the start of the series, wet dish rag Elena Gilbert has recently lost her parents in a car accident, and in her grief, broke up with her childhood sweetheart, Matt. As a new school year begins, enter Stefan Salvatore, an eternal seventeen-year-old vampire who immediately falls in love with Elena because…because? A HUGE problem for The Vampire Diaries right out of the gate is that Elena is a TOTAL DRAG. This is nothing on Nina Dobrev, whose acting is, mostly, unobjectionable. She is doing her best. It’s just that this character SUCKS. I understand the setup, that Stefan’s interest is caught because Elena looks just like Katherine, Stefan’s supposed-dead vampire love from the Civil War. But why does everyone who meets Elena immediately fall for her? She is so BORING. Elena’s personality is just a series of confused faces.</p>
<p>The other point on this love triangle is Damon Salvatore, Stefan’s older, black-sheep brother, also a vampire, also formerly in love with Katherine. Duana recommended I stick with TVD long enough for Ian Somerhalder to “really start chewing on some stuff”, and it’s true, the more he gets to do, the better the show gets. Taking Duana’s advice, I skipped to the finale of season one and proceeded from there, which is the best way to watch this show. Season one is VERY frustrating, lots of moping and table setting and too much Elena. But season two shifts into more of an ensemble piece, and by season three it really takes off with multiple storylines and several characters much more interesting than Elena, including Damon. I don’t understand why he falls for Elena, either, but at this point, I have given up on understanding. I’m not really watching the show for the love triangle anyway. Really, I’m all about…</p>
<p>Watch for Bonnie and Caroline</p>
<p>THESE are the best characters on the show. Bonnie is a witch who is constantly saving everybody because she is the only capable person in her social circle. And Caroline is a newly-turned vampire who goes through some SH-T with her family. Caroline is hilarious and she gets more interesting with every episode, and I am now at the part where she is hate-flirting with the bad vampire, Klaus, and HERE is a love story I can get into. I don’t know if I’ll finish all eight seasons of TVD, because I tend to just get tired of things and move on, but I will stick with it long enough to see what happens with Caroline and Klaus.</p>
<p>Bonnie, though, as much as I like her, walks into some gross subtext with this show. Bonnie is the only main character of color, and she is a witch, something that is constant (so far) on TVD. Almost all of the witches we’ve seen are people of color. And pretty much all of them die. It’s not a great look. And it’s compounded in its badness by Bonnie’s ancestor, Emily, who helped Katherine back in the Civil War days. I say “helped”, but maybe Emily was a slave? It’s not clear. In the show, she is referred to as a “handmaiden”, but she is also a black woman in antebellum Virginia. Where else am I supposed to go with that? TVD wants nothing to do with these connotations, at one point blowing off the relationship between the modern-day townspeople and their antebellum antecedents with a casual, “This is the South, and no one likes to reminisce about the slave days.” What?! Did I miss the backlash to this, or did TVD get a huge pass for its frankly gross racial politics? I love Bonnie, and she deserves a lot better than the way this show treats her heritage.</p>
<p>It never should have been set in the South</p>
<p>I get that this is based on a book series and inherited its setting from that, but if you don’t want to treat the history of this fake town, which revolves so heavily on what happened during the Civil War, with any kind of dignity or meaning, just move it out of the South. It’s too loaded at this point for such a cavalier approach. In one episode, Damon is proud to be in the Confederate Army (truly, the WORST thing he’s ever done, and he’s murdered like 967 people), but a few episodes later we find out he’s deserted because of “morals”. TVD takes every opportunity to shortchange and dismiss its antebellum setting in a way that renders it meaningless. There is a version of this show where the generational pain carried by these characters is directly and meaningfully related to their experiences in the Civil War, but that is not the TVD I am watching. The TVD I am watching would be much better off for not being set in the South. The show doesn’t want to have anything to do with it anyway, so why not just change the setting? Spare us all the awkward references to the Confederacy, which never amounts to anything more than window dressing, anyway.</p>
<p>It’s completely binge-able anyway</p>
<p>Weird Southern politics aside, The Vampire Diaries is SUPER binge-able. The soapy teen drama is VERY soapy and VERY dramatic. There are so many plots and plans and double-crosses, episodes fly by fast, and I always like a show with budget restraints trying to recreate historical periods. I genuinely like to see how the set and wardrobe departments deal with the challenge of staging scenes in Renaissance England with a ten-dollar budget. It’s the epitome of creative problem solving, and it is to TVD’s credit that their flashback scenes usually look pretty convincing. Even if I don’t care about all the characters equally, Bonnie and Caroline are great and season three, especially, is really bringing the Caroline goods to the table. I do recommend this for a binge, though I really want to talk to someone about the creepy romanticizing of the Civil War South.</p>

<h3 id="the-vampire-diaries-10-cose-che-forse-non-sapete">The Vampire Diaries: 10 cose che forse non sapete</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.iodonna.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/vampire-diaries.jpg" alt="img">
Questo isolamento ha riservato una piacevole sorpresa per tutte quelle fan che troppo a lungo hanno avuto il cuore diviso a metà tra i fratelli Salvatore, interpretati da Ian Somerhalder e Paul Wesley, ma anche per chi ha sempre saputo da che parte stare, #teamDamon o #teamStefan che fosse.</p>
<p>Su La5 sono tornati gli episodi di The Vampire Diaries, serie creata da Kevin Williamson e Julie Plec e tratta da una serie di romanzi scritti da Lisa J. Smith a partire dal 1991 (“Il diario del vampiro”).</p>
<p>Per chi fosse poco pratico di storie fantasy (e del fascino di Ian Somerhalder), la saga racconta le vicende dei fratelli Damon e Stefan Salvatore, due vampiri trasferitisi nella cittadina di Mystic Falls, e del loro amore conteso per la giovane Elena Gilbert, interpretata da Nina Dobrev.</p>
<p>Che siate fan della prima ora o nuovi adepti, non potete perdervi le curiosità e i retroscena di questa serie cult.</p>
<p>Ruoli contesi</p>
<p>A chi conosce bene i fratelli Salvatore sembrerà strano, ma l’attore che interpreta Stefan (Paul Wesley) aveva inizialmente fatto l’audizione per il ruolo di Damon. La parte andò poi a Ian Somerhalder, che invece aveva provato ad entrare nel cast di un’altra famosa serie di vampiri, True Blood. Ma l’attore non ha solo recitato nella serie: ha anche firmato la regia di tre episodi.</p>
<p>Mystic Falls e i Salvatore</p>
<p>La produzione ha cambiato (o ci ha provato) un po’ le carte in tavola con alcuni nomi della saga. Mystic Falls doveva chiamarsi in realtà Fell’s Church, ritenuto poi troppo “spirituale”, e i fratelli Salvatore hanno rischiato di diventare i fratelli Whitmore.</p>
<p>Il sangue di The Vampire Diaries</p>
<p>Tutti sanno di cosa si nutrono i vampiri, ma forse non tutti conoscono la ricetta del sangue finto: colorante, sciroppo di mais, sale ed estratto di menta.</p>
<p>Lo show ha anche partecipato alla campagna della Croce Rossa per promuovere la donazione di sangue tra i giovani.</p>
<p>Un cast poliglotta</p>
<p>Tra gli attori molti parlano diverse lingue: ad esempio Nina Dobrev, nata a Sofia, parla bulgaro, mentre Kat Graham, che interpreta Bonnie, parla spagnolo, francese ed ebraico.</p>
<p>Le 8 stagioni di The Vampire Diaries non vi bastano? Non disperate. La saga ha due spin-off: The Originals e Legacies.

Candice King toured with Hannah Montana</p>
<p>Candice King was a backup singer for Hannah Montana years before she found fame on The Vampire Diaries.</p>
<p>The actress played fan favourite Caroline Forbes in the hit CW series from 2009 to 2017.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a true Candice King fan then this is probably old news to you.</p>
<p>However, we couldn&rsquo;t believe our eyes when TikTok user @nabiibi made the revelation on the video sharing app.</p>
<p>She posted a clip from the Disney+ movie Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus: Best of Both World&rsquo;s Concert.</p>
<p>In an interview with Clevver TV in 2011, Candice shared how she became a backup singer for Hannah.</p>
<p>She revealed she got a phone call from the music director of the show offering her the position.</p>
<p>Candice shared that she hadn&rsquo;t actually heard of Hannah Montana at the time.</p>
<p>The actress revealed it became the biggest selling tour in a decade.</p>
<p>She said it was six months of her life that she will never forget, &ldquo;I was 20-years-old travelling around the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miley&rsquo;s an incredibly talented young woman&hellip; I was just very fortunate to be a part of such an epic experience.&rdquo;</p>
