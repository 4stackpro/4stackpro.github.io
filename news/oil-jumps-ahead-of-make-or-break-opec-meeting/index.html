Oil prices moved higher on Thursday, ahead of a pivotal meeting in which OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, will discuss historic production cuts as the coronavirus pandemic continues to sap demand for crude.</p>
<p>U.S. West Texas Intermediate traded 5.9%, or $1.48, higher at $26.57 per barrel, while international benchmark Brent crude rose 3.9% to $34.12 per barrel.</p>
<p>The move higher came even as a Kremlin spokesman said Russian President Putin had no plans to discuss oil policy with President Donald Trump, according to a report from Reuters. Saudi Arabia also reportedly said any output cut would be from the elevated production levels it reached this month, according to Reuters citing a source briefed on Saudi Policy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re optimistic that they&rsquo;ll reach an agreement between the Saudis and Russians in an effort to stabilize the markets,&rdquo; U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said Thursday on CNBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Squawk Box.&rdquo; &ldquo;I think they can easily get to 10 million, perhaps even higher, and certainly higher if you include the other nations who produce oil, nations like Canada and Brazil and others. Easily, easily done,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>The virtual meeting, which was initially supposed to take place on Monday, will begin around 10 a.m. ET. President Donald Trump has fueled hopes of a cut far larger than any deal OPEC+ has ever agreed on before, suggesting the energy alliance could take between 10 million to 15 million barrels of crude off the market.</p>
<p>The meeting comes as relations between some of the world&rsquo;s largest producers has grown fraught, and Saudi Arabia and Russia have signaled that any cut would need to include action from non-OPEC nations such as the U.S., Canada and Norway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OPEC+ is trying mightily to cobble together a sizable production cut, and they are in full spin mode to try and rally prices,&rdquo; Again Capital&rsquo;s John Kilduff told CNBC. The &ldquo;teleconference will be a make-or-break moment for the oil market. The math on a 10 million barrel per day cutback, which is the minimum necessary to stabilize the situation, is almost impossible to compute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Energy ministers from the Group of 20 major economies will convene for their own extraordinary meeting on Friday, in which Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette will participate.</p>
<p>The G-20 presidency said Tuesday that the meeting would be held &ldquo;to foster global dialogue and cooperation to ensure stable energy markets and enable a stronger global economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When it comes to U.S. energy companies, Trump has commented that market forces will prevail, and on Wednesday said that producers have &ldquo;already cut way back.&rdquo; Brouillette echoed this on Thursday, telling CNBC that the &ldquo;demand downturn has led to production cuts in the United States of about 2 million barrels per day thought the reminder of 2020.&rdquo;</p>
<p>RBC global head of commodities research Helima Croft said she believes the chances &ldquo;are greater than even&rdquo; that &ldquo;a broad framework agreement to curb output by a big headline number&rdquo; can be achieved, but noted that &ldquo;the situation remains extremely fluid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are several land mines lurking right below the surface that could still blow up the negotiations at the 11th hour,&rdquo; she said in a note to clients Thursday.</p>
<p>But even if a deal is reached, many argue that prices will stay lower for longer due to the unprecedented demand destruction caused by the coronavirus. In other words, the supply side is a secondary story to the demand hit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be prepared for another drop in oil prices soon, when market participants realize that the real issue they have to deal with is the declining demand, for which the proposed cuts, even if realized, are set to fail to bridge the gap,&rdquo; said Bjornar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets at Rystad Energy.

<h3 id="ringgit-moves-higher-on-optimism-over-opec-meeting">Ringgit moves higher on optimism over Opec meeting</h3>
<p><img src="https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/04/09/637274.jpg" alt="img">
KUALA LUMPUR: The ringgit traded higher against the US dollar in the early session today lifted by improved global sentiment in the equities and commodities market ahead of Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) + meeting later today.</p>
<p>At 9.03 am, the ringgit was quoted at 4.3300/3400 against the US dollar compared with Wednesday&rsquo;s close of 4.3450/3545.</p>
<p>AxiCorp global chief market strategist Stephen Innes said given the recent correlation of ringgit to oil prices and global risk sentiment the local currency should have a favourable day today.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With investors awaiting the results of a high stakes OPEC + meeting, if anything the ringgit may trade with a more guarded optimistic tone today,” he said Meanwhile, Bank Islam chief economist Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said talks of the possible reopening of some parts of the US have contributed to the positive sentiments to the equities market.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, the lower number of COVID-19 fatalities in the state of New York and New Jersey have lifted major equity indices in the US by more than seven per cent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, the number of new confirmed cases are still rising and to date, there is no credible signs of vaccine or antibodies have been discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that sense, we still think the forex market is still fragile. Perhaps, the ringgit would still linger around RM4.35 against US dollar in the immediate terms,” he told Bernama.</p>
<p>The ringgit traded mostly higher against a basket of major currencies except the British pound.</p>
<p>It increased vis-a-vis the euro at 4.7076/7202 compared to the 4.7200/7320 on Wednesday’s close and rose against the Singapore dollar to 3.0386/0465 from 3.0406/0487.</p>
<p>The local unit advanced versus the Japanese yen to 3.9721/9824 from 3.9906/0005 but depreciated against the British pound to 5.3744/3885 from 5.3552/3682 yesterday. - Bernama
