<p>New research from two MIT economists gives a whole new meaning to being asleep on the job.</p>
<p>In their paper “The Economic Consequences of Increasing Sleep Among the Urban Poor,” Pedro Bessone and Frank Schilbach found that after more than three weeks of daily 30-minute naps, employees at a data-entry job were 2.3% more productive and invested more of their money into savings accounts.</p>
<p>Work smart with our Thinking Forward newsletter Insights from MIT experts, delivered every Tuesday morning. Email Address</p>
<p>“These findings serve as a proof of concept that sleep can affect important economic outcomes relatively quickly,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>Bessone and Schilbach conducted their sleep research along with Heather Schofield of the University of Pennsylvania, and Gautam Rao and Mattie Toma, both from Harvard.</p>
<p>The research took place from October 2017 to April 2019, and involved randomly splitting 452 low-income workers in Chennai, India, into three groups: those who received treatments to increase their nighttime sleep at home, those given the opportunity to nap at their workplace to increase their daytime sleep, and a control group.</p>
<p>The researchers also measured savings behavior, by allowing the participants in either testing group to save money in a locked box at the study office, with randomly assigned daily interest rates between 0-2%.</p>
<p>At the end of each work day, after receiving money for their daily shift, the study participants could deposit or withdraw money from their savings boxes.</p>
<p>The nap treatment increased productivity in the workers’ data entry jobs, psychological well-being, as well as workers’ patience and attention, said Rao during a recent presentation at MIT.</p>
<p>The treatment that included additional nighttime sleep showed a minimal increase in workers’ productivity, and in fact the added time in bed led to a decrease in hours worked, causing a small decrease in earnings for those workers in the night-sleep treatment.</p>
<p>“Contrary to expert predictions and contrary to our own priors, we find that the night-sleep treatments basically have no positive effects,” Rao said.</p>
<p>The researchers based their study on the standard 7 to 9 hours of sleep recommended by sleep experts. The workers in the study got an average of 5.6 hours of sleep and woke up 32 times a night.</p>
<p>“Sleep could be particularly poor in cities in developing countries, where living environments are replete with irritants like noise, heat, and physical discomfort,” the study states.</p>
<p>According to a 2019 report, about 40% of Chennai’s population lives below the poverty line.</p>
<p>Here’s a closer look at their results:</p>
<p>Night-sleep treatment</p>
<p>Those in the night-sleep treatments were randomly divided into one of three groups:</p>
<p>Sleep items: participants borrowed items like earplugs and eye masks, and were encouraged to sleep more.</p>
<p>Sleep items and incentives: participants received the items and encouragement to increase their sleep, and earned 1 rupee per minute of increased sleep for up to two hours of increased sleep (120 rupees equaled about $1.70 at the time).</p>
<p>Control: participants could not borrow items, and did not receive any of the encouragement nor monetary incentives to increase sleep.</p>
<p>All participants were provided with wristwatch-like actigraphs, devices that measured when someone was awake or asleep, as well as sleep quality through body motion.</p>
<p>On average, workers in the sleep items group increased their time asleep by 20 minutes, while those in the items and incentives group increased their time asleep by 33 minutes. Respectively, they increased their time in bed by 31 minutes and 46 minutes.</p>
<p>There was no change to the number of awakenings per hour during the night, and minimal improvement to the longest period of sleep.</p>
<p>The participants in this group saw a 1.3% increase in productivity, which was smaller than the 7% increase in output predicted by sleep and economics experts surveyed by the researchers.</p>
<p>The night treatment also reduced labor supply by about 10 minutes every day, since people were spending more time in bed and less time in the office.</p>
<p>“Contrary to our expectations, on average we do not find evidence that increasing night sleep had any effects on the outcomes we study,” Schilbach said. “We do find some evidence of productivity effects among people who enjoy better-quality sleep at the beginning of the study but even those effects are moderate. Overall, this evidence suggests that the profound effects found in the sleep literature may not extend to settings outside of sleep labs, especially for people with difficult sleeping conditions.”</p>
<p>Schilbach added that it’s important to note that the effects of the night sleep don’t necessarily extend to other settings, including the United States, since sleeping conditions and quality are so different in rich countries.</p>
<p>“A key question arising from our work is how to improve sleep quality among low-income workers, which could have high economic returns,” Schilbach said.</p>
<p>Nap treatment</p>
<p>For those in the nap treatment group, participants were given the opportunity to take a nap every day between 1:30 p.m. and 2 p.m. at their workplace.</p>
<p>The nap area was gender-separated, away from the working part of the office, and included things like a bed, pillow, table fan, ear plugs, and eye mask.</p>
<p>“While roughly 90% of individuals in this condition did indeed sleep during their allotted nap time, study participants who did not want to nap were asked to sit quietly or rest in their nap area,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>The participants who were not randomly assigned to the nap treatment group were further randomized — on a daily basis — into one of two conditions:</p>
<p>Work through the nap period.</p>
<p>Take a 30-minute break for a leisure activity or to sit in a break room.</p>
<p>While participants in the nap treatment group only spent about 13 minutes asleep, they were on average 2.3% more productive per day. They were also more alert to performance-pay incentives during the work day, and based on data collected on their well-being, appeared to be positively impacted by napping in terms of happiness and life satisfaction.</p>
<p>“Given the impacts on attention, it seems reasonable to expect that naps are more helpful for workers engaged in cognitively demanding tasks,” Schilbach said.</p>
<p>The people who were instructed to take naps also saved an additional 16 rupees per day into their savings boxes, equal to a 15% increase compared to the control group, the researchers found.</p>
<p>The researchers acknowledged that naps might be particularly beneficial in their study because the timing of the naps was chosen to coincide with a daily drop in energy for participants in the early afternoon. They also acknowledged that more sleep at night might show more effects over a longer period of time.</p>
<p>“Naps do not ‘pay for themselves,’ i.e. they do not increase overall output since they reduce overall hours worked,” Schilbach said. “However, firms might nevertheless want to offer naps to workers to improve the well-being and satisfaction of their workforce.”</p>

<p>The tomatoes were grown and harvested from the NMC-CREES agriculture development and research farm in as Perdido, he added.</p>
<p>It was Virendra M. Verma, Ph.D., program leader and specialist (horticulture/crop) agricultural program of NMC-CREES, who provided the tomatoes to NAP. Verma said the types of tomatoes donated included Big Beef, Florida, Dixie Red, Nature Bite, Regal Plum, Cherry Plum, Bellini and Bluish Tiger.</p>
<p>On behalf of NAP and its recipients, Macaranas expressed his gratitude to NMC-CREES, its dean, Patty Coleman, and staffers.</p>
<p>The pre-packed tomatoes that CREES donated on Thursday were immediately distributed to NAP recipients while they were at the “drive-thru” benefits distribution line, Macaranas added.</p>
<p>“The recipients were amazed by the nice, bright red tomatoes and were very happy to receive them,” he said.

<h3 id="taking-a-nap-playing-ludo-gujarat-pharma-hub-hit-by-near-zero-exports">Taking a nap, playing ludo: Gujarat pharma hub hit by near-zero exports</h3>
<p><img src="https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2020-04/13/full/1586798711-8743.jpg" alt="img">
At a petrol pump on the deserted Bavla-Changodar highway near Ahmedabad in Gujarat, several trucks and buses are neatly parked in a row. Some of the drivers are taking a nap, while some others play Ludo on their mobile phones, even as they maintain physical distance from each other.</p>
<p>The highway cuts across one of the busiest pharmaceutical hubs in the country. But that was before the nationwide lockdown to battle the pandemic came into force.</p>
<p>Today, the hub, which consists of big, mid-sized and small pharma companies, wears a desolate look.With the government asking the to operate with only 50 per cent staff strength, and exports dipping to almost zero, the truck and bus drivers idling at the petrol pump say they hardly have any work now.</p>
<p>“The number of trucks plying here have fallen by more than 70 per cent. This is because exports are almost at a standstill and the pharma are now catering only to the domestic market. Raw material from other states are also not coming as often as they used to,” says Kalubhai Damor, a driver for one of the big in the pharma Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Changodar.</p>

<p>Kamlesh Prajapati, who operates a commercial tempo for pick-up and delivery of goods for companies like Zydus Cadila and Intas, says his weekly trips have fallen from three to one.</p>
<p>Transportation has been hit also because the number of drivers has dwindled. Prakash Singal, who usually delivers metal parts for auto companies, is now serving pharma companies since his colleague got stuck in the village when the lockdown began.</p>
<p>Pharma companies say that they are doing the best they can under the circumstances.</p>

<p>“All our plants are functional to ensure that the essential requirements are met. We are taking all precautions as per the government and Indian Pharmaceutical Association guidelines. The plants are operating with minimal manpower to prevent overcrowding. Wherever possible, we are ensuring the delivery of medicines to the stockists. One of the initial challenges we faced was the availability of drivers and loaders, but things have improved gradually,” says KVR Sarma, vice-president and head-supply chain, at Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd (Zydus Cadila).</p>
<p>Though the is coping with the lockdown by focusing on the domestic market, the sourcing of raw materials has become an issue. As Vijay Shah, member of the Committee of Administration (CoA) at Pharmaceutical Export Promotion Council (Pharmexcil), points out, “Flights and ports are closed and workers are not available. Transportation is not fully operational and hence, sourcing of raw materials, such as active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), has become very difficult.”</p>
<p>Shah, who also runs a small drug firm called Stallion Laboratories Pvt. Ltd, goes on to add that though there are warehouses in Bhiwandi and other areas of Mumbai which stock API, it is not able to move beyond state borders.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: As road sector gears up to resume work, uncertainty looms over compensation</p>
<p>While mid-sized companies like Lincoln Pharmaceuticals Ltd. have a decent inventory of API that could last the duration of the lockdown, smaller ones like Stallion are concerned about depleting resources. “The government has been making efforts, but because of the lack of workers and hiccups in supply logistics, our API stock of 45 days could get exhausted soon,” says Shah.</p>
<p>Viranchi Shah, chairman, Gujarat, Indian Drugs Manufacturers&rsquo; Association (IDMA), says that pharma companies are trying to adapt to the new reality of almost zero exports.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Challenges such as non-availability of ample workers as well as international logistics remain. Gujarat is one of the leading pharma export hubs globally. But since airports and ports are shut and freighter cargo movement is almost at a standstill, production capabilities have been shifted from exports to the domestic market,” says Shah of IDMA.</p>

<p>For instance, Lincoln Pharma, which manufactures oral solid doses (OSDs) and parenterals (drugs administered via infusion or injection) largely for markets in the African countries, has quickly adapted itself to serve the domestic market. The company is running on a 70 per cent capacity utilisation since the beginning of the lockdown at its plant at Khatraj, which is otherwise capable of making 150 million OSDs, seven million injectables and 1-1.2 million liquid oral doses per month.</p>
<p>“The drugs we manufacture, including paracetamol and azithromycin, are needed in the domestic market. Hence, production has not been impacted even as we take the necessary precautions of engaging only 50 per cent staff and ensuring thorough screening and sanitization of personnel, vehicles and premises. We also have an API inventory of over one month, which is sufficient for now,” says Sanjay J Bhatt, general manager, operations and plant head, at Lincoln Pharma.</p>
<p>The has been trying to resolve the issues that the companies are facing. In a letter to the minister of commerce and industries, industry body Pharmexcil has written that several of its members are reporting cancellation of orders.</p>

<p>“India is being replaced by other countries like Brazil, China, Turkey and some other countries in East Asia. Member companies are facing considerable problems in bringing their import shipments from airports and ports to their warehouses. The imports are essential raw materials for manufacturing essential products/medical devices to fight Covid-19,” the letter states.</p>
<p>Pharmexcil has also requested that the lockdown be lifted in the case of factories engaged in exports, since foreign buyers have started cancelling orders and switching to competing countries.</p>
<p>Moreover, in its letter to the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Pharmexcil has stated that its roughly 3500 member companies, that generate a turnover of $50 billion, are seeking an extension of six months for making payments to the banks against the letters of credit for exports.</p>
<p>“This is very urgently needed on account of the huge disruption which has been created all over the world on account of Covid-19,” states Pharmexcil’s letter to the central bank.</p>
