<p>In a 5-4 vote Thursday, the state Supreme Court of Washington rejected a lawsuit calling for the release of thousands of inmates to help stem the spread of the coronavirus, according to reports.</p>
<p>Those narrowly missing a shot at freedom included Gary Ridgway, the so-called “Green River Killer,” who in 2003 was sentenced to life in prison after confessing to killing as many as 49 women in the 1980s, Seattle’s KIRO radio reported.</p>
<p>GREEN RIVER KILLER GARY RIDGWAY IS STILL HIDING MANY &lsquo;DARK SECRETS&rsquo; DESPITE CONFESSION, SAYS PROSECUTOR IN NEW DOCUMENTARY</p>
<p>A lawyer representing the inmates being considered for release – about two-thirds of the state’s prison population, according to KIRO – argued that those behind bars aren’t able to keep themselves safe from the virus. He said those inmates who were elderly, in poor health or very close to their release date should be set free, Q13 FOX of Seattle reported.</p>
<p>“We can all hold out in our homes. We can decide who we allow into our homes,” lawyer Nicholas Straley said. “People in prison do not have that option.”</p>
<p>Assistant Attorney General John Samson, arguing against the mass release, told the court that inmates had received face masks and separated sleep spaces, and the corrections department had conducted virus testing on 300 inmates and released some offenders.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the court order signed by Chief Justice Debra Stephens said the petitioners bringing the lawsuit had failed to prove the state’s treatment of the inmates amounted to “deliberate indifference” to the COVID-19 risk within the state’s detention centers, The Seattle Times reported.</p>
<p>At least 24 corrections department employees and 13 inmates have tested positive for the virus, with other inmates placed in isolation or quarantined, the report said.</p>
<p>On April 10, the state Supreme Court had asked the state to draft a plan for protecting inmates from the outbreak, Q13 FOX reported.</p>
<p>As the justices heard arguments, state Republicans, law enforcement officials and crime victims spoke out against the proposal to release the inmates, the station reported.</p>

<p>Ridgway, now 70 years old, is the subject of a recent TV documentary titled, “The Green River Killer: Mind of a Monster.” It features chilling tapes of Ridgway’s police interviews, uses the murderer’s own disturbing words to detail what ultimately led him to become a violent predator.</p>
<p>Ridgway confessed to strangling prostitutes, runaways and other overlooked members of society in his pickup truck while having sex with them, the New York Times reported. He would then dump their bodies around the Seattle area. According to the outlet, prosecutors said Ridgway had told them he killed 60 women but they were able to gather only enough evidence to conclusively link him to 49 murders.</p>

<h3 id="48-murders-the-hunt-for-gary-ridgway-the-green-river-killer">48 murders: The hunt for Gary Ridgway, the Green River Killer</h3>
<p><img src="https://filmdaily.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/gary-ridgway-lede-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="img">
48 murders: The hunt for Gary Ridgway, the Green River Killer</p>
<p>The Green River Killer was named such because he killed and disposed of some of his victims on the banks of the Green River in Washington state. He killed for almost two decades. The Green River Killer’s real name is Gary Ridgeway and he would later graduate to dumping bodies in forests and purposely contaminating his crime scenes.</p>
<p>Gary Ridgway used to be considered the most prolific killer in American history. This title has since been taken by Samuel Little, but Ridgway can still keep the title as one of the vilest men alive.</p>
<p>Catching Ridgway took an unfortunate amount of time for police and left the people of Washington in a constant state of wariness. As is unfortunately often the case, it’s the women of Washington who really had something to worry about, more specifically women prostitutes. This was Ridgway’s type.</p>
<p>The hunt for the Green River Killer left authorities and civilians alike very frustrated for a very long time. It would cost taxpayers $15 million to launch an investigation that yielded no killer. The case grew cold until Ridgway was finally caught in 2001.</p>
<p>Gary Ridgway’s beginnings</p>
<p>Gary Ridgway was born in Salt Lake City, Utah to parents who (according to relatives) often had heated arguments. His father was a bus driver and his mother was domineering.</p>
<p>At age 13, Ridgway was still wetting the bed. It’s said that his mother was so overbearing that whenever he had an accident at night she would wash his genitals herself. Naturally, as a boy entering into puberty, Ridgway would experience uninvited excitement in response to these episodes. He would grow to resent his mother for this in a convoluted mix of sexual attraction and hatred.</p>
<p>Ridgway says that he used to fantasize about killing his mother. He would channel his evil urges into setting fires and torturing animals until one day he stabbed a boy in the liver at age sixteen.</p>
<p>Ridgway’s father was very religious and frequently discussed his distaste for seeing prostitutes in the city while Ridgway was growing up. These constant gripes instilled in Ridgway a deep scorn for women engaged in sex work and become partially the reason they would become his primary targets once he started killing.</p>
<p>Chasing Gary Ridgway</p>
<p>Ridgway says “I picked prostitutes as my victims because I hate most prostitutes and I did not want to pay them for sex.”</p>
<p>So despite his hatred for prostitutes, Ridgway still engaged in sex with them. Probably the sickest part of his killing ritual was the fact that he engaged in necrophilia after strangling them, sometimes returning to their corpses for days in a row until flies began to gather.</p>
<p>When police found bodies in the Green River in 1982 they launched a full fledged investigation to find the murderer that was stalking the King County area. Ridgway often placed his victims in groups, even going as far as posing them sometimes. Because of this, it was clear to police that they had a serial killer on their hands.</p>
<p>Gary Ridgway was actually picked up for prostitution charges by police in 1982 and again in 1984. They began to suspect him for the murders so they made him take a polygraph test. He seemed to pass with flying colors so police released him, but not before taking samples of his hair and saliva.</p>
<p>In 1984, authorities were so distraught with their lack of progress that they sought serial killer Ted Bundy for help. Bundy gave them pointers like the fact that the Green River Killer was likely killing near his home and returning to his dump sites to engage in necrophilia. Despite these leads, police still couldn’t find the Green River Killer.</p>
<p>In 2001, DNA technology had advanced so they reexamined the samples they had, comparing semen from the crime scenes to the hair sample they had taken from Gary Ridgway. At last, they had found a match.</p>
<p>They later even realized that someone had misread Ridgway’s polygraph’s results and that he had actually failed it. Had Ridgway been caught at that time instead of 2001, it would have spared almost half his victim’s lives.</p>
<p>Gary Ridgway is put on trial</p>
<p>In a strategic move, Ridgway was only charged with seven of the murders because those were the only ones police were confident they could get a conviction on. Ridgway was convicted for all seven, and then the district attorney made a very controversial move. He offered Ridgway a plea bargain for life imprisonment instead of the death penalty if he gave them information on the rest of his murders.</p>
<p>Ridgway confessed to all 41 additional murders. The Prosecuting attorney Norm Maleng explained “Gary Ridgway does not deserve our mercy. He does not deserve to live. The mercy provided by today’s resolution is directed not at Ridgway, but toward the families who have suffered so much.”</p>
<p>Police later found 1 more victim so Ridgway ended up convicted of 49 murders total. Ridgway now rots in Walla Walla Washington State Penitentiary.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>A 2005 slasher film called Green River Killer was made based on Gary Ridgway’s crimes.</p>
