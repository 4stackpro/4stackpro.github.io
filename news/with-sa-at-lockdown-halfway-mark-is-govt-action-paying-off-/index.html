With SA at lockdown halfway mark, is govt action paying off?</p>
<p>South Africa has 1,655 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 11 fatalities have been recorded and have been 45 recoveries.</p>
<p>CAPE TOWN - The South African government has taken bold steps to stop the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>With a rise in the number of confirmed cases, President Cyril Ramaphosa imposed a national 21-day lockdown.</p>
<p>This resulted in the closure of learning institutions and most businesses.</p>
<p>Travel restrictions were also imposed.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re almost at the halfway mark of the lockdown.</p>
<p>How have we faired so far?</p>
<p>While it may be early to tell on the health front, according to Police Minister Bheki Cele there&rsquo;s been a reduction in crime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alcohol is the part of the biggest generators of crime, so South Africans have to look at that and see how they can change their headaches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Government has, however, stressed the importance of people staying indoors and adhering to lockdown regulations in a bid to stop the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>South Africa has 1,655 confirmed COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>Eleven fatalities have been recorded.</p>
<p>There have been 45 recoveries.</p>
<p>At the same time, President Cyril Ramaphosa met with religious leaders on Sunday to ask for advice and prayers to usher the country through the rest of the lockdown period.</p>

As the SA lockdown hit day 10, many South Africans took to social media to share how they are coping since the sale of some products have been banned for the 21-day period.</p>
<p>TimesLIVE reported that police minister Bheki Cele has reiterated government&rsquo;s decision not to allow the trading of alcohol and cigarettes, which have both been deemed as non-essential items.</p>
<p>Cele was responding to reports that the Western Cape had relaxed rules on the sale of cigarettes.</p>
<p>“There is no province that has a special dispensation out of the regulations that have been signed by the minister,&rdquo; Cele said.

<h3 id="shadow-minister-slams-south-africas-authoritarian-lockdown-laws">Shadow minister slams South Africa’s ‘authoritarian’ lockdown laws</h3>
<p><img src="https://gcs.thesouthafrican.com/2020/03/18859164-sandf-south-africa-lockdown.jpg" alt="img">
Dean Macpherson, an elected MP and DA shadow minister, has hit out at the way government is pursuing their newly established lockdown laws. The frustration comes after numerous stores reported that they weren’t selling certain hot foods, and complained of having to ‘sit on their stock’.</p>
<p>As prescribed by the National Disaster Act, South African shops are only allowed to sell ‘essential items’. The government have failed to clearly explain what this entails, leading to nationwide confusion. Macpherson himself rallied again the ban on hairbrushes and gardening equipment on Saturday.</p>
<p>Lockdown laws in South Africa – how much is too much?</p>
<p>But it would be another Tweet – which followed an official statement from his office – That turned heads. The DA’s trade and industry official said that SA was sliding towards an ‘authoritarian system’, and lamented the ANC for what he sees as a failure to ‘learn from our history’, referencing the cruel regime of apartheid.</p>
<p>“What the lockdown has shown is that are probably large numbers of people in South Africa who have no problem living under an authoritarian system where they are told what they can and can’t buy and when they can and can’t go out. It’s like we’ve learnt nothing from our history.” “It is illogical and makes no sense for instance that a store at a petrol station is not allowed to sell pies or that a grocery store is not allowed to sell prepared, warm food. We have seen even more ridiculous examples of this in this week of lockdown such as retail stores closing their magazines and snacks shelves and mothers of newborn babies not being able to buy clothes for their babies.”</p>
<p>Ministers flip-flop on rules</p>
<p>The reaction has been vociferous, with some accusing Macpherson of misreading the situation. However, the politician has stuck to his guns on Sunday, taking aim at Bheki Cele instead. The police minister has hinted he’d like to keep alcohol prohibition in place after lockdown – much to the chagrin of the DA:
