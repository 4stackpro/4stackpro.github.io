Navis, a part of Cargotec Corporation, has announced that Yilport Holding has implemented Navis Smart Compass at five terminals, following a pilot programme in May 2020.</p>
<p>Due to the success of the programme at terminals that use Navis N4, Yilport made the decision to implement the solution more widely for enhanced data sharing, communication and visibility, in addition to enabling remote operation capabilities among its global teams.</p>
<p>As one of the leading terminal operators, Yilport currently operates 22 marine ports and terminals globally handling 12 million TEU’s for containers and 22 million tons in general and dry bulk cargo annually.</p>
<p>With its goals to scale operations by 2025, Yilport has been implementing state-of-the-art technology and solutions, including the establishment of its Global Logistics Center (GLC) in 2015, to provide better, centralised services across its international terminals.</p>
<p>Navis Technical Paper: 30 Years of Port Robotics</p>
<p>Navis Compass will help real-time visibility and data sharing among Yilport’s vast terminal network.</p>
<p>“Navis Smart Compass has been a game changer for our port operations and management. As a pilot partner for Navis Compass, we worked closely with the Navis team to give feedback on the solution and help shape it for optimal terminal planning and execution processes,” said Cem Goktaş, Global Operations Director, Yilport.</p>
<p>“Now all users, regardless of where they are located, can see all information regarding upcoming vessel visits to know exactly what tasks need to be done and who is working on them, saving us time, money and reducing the risk of human error.”</p>
<p>The Yilport operations, customer service, data management and planning departments will use the Compass application for visibility and communication for a number of tasks between teams which will help centralize and standardize planning and execution processes.</p>
<p>Additionally, the automated functions will help them manage several terminals at a time in a more reliable and efficient way to help monitor workflow.</p>
<p>“At Navis, we are constantly innovating our suite of applications and services to deliver better tools to our customers,” said Chuck Schneider, Chief Customer Officer at Navis.</p>
<p>“Global terminal networks like Yilport using our connected suite of solutions for remote operations can enable more effective terminal operations to keep cargo moving safely to serve the essential needs of our local and global communities.”

<h3 id="compass-can-outlast-downturn-of-6-to-9-months-reffkin">Compass Can Outlast Downturn of 6 to 9 Months: Reffkin</h3>
<p><img src="https://therealdeal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ft-compass-cash-for-months.jpg" alt="img">
Compass is one of the richest residential brokerages, fortified with $1.5 billion in venture capital. Now facing an uncertain economic future, the company said it has enough cash to withstand a slump of two or three quarters.</p>
<p>“We can sustain a downturn for six months, eight months, nine months,” CEO Robert Reffkin said during an interview on Los Angeles agent Danny Brown’s podcast, The Deal. “We have the capital to be able to do so.”</p>
<p>Reffkin’s comments come as the SoftBank-backed firm faces a potential 50 percent drop in revenue thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. The firm, valued at $6.4 billion, sold $88 billion worth of real estate last year, up from $45.5 billion in 2018. As of October 2019, it was projecting $2 billion in 2019 revenue and said it had run-rate revenue of $3 billion.</p>
<p>Last month, Compass laid off 15 percent of its staff — roughly 375 people — in anticipation of an “economic standstill.” At the time, Reffkin projected a steep revenue decrease over the next six months.</p>
<p>On the podcast, he said Compass was in a lucky position, and that firms that are not so well capitalized are likely to pursue mergers or partnerships to stay afloat.</p>
<p>He noted, too, that Compass has seen an uptick in agents joining the firm. “We’re able to onboard agents virtually,” he said. “The great agents always gain market share in a downturn. It’s a question of how much market share you can gain.”</p>
<p>Residential firms around the country have laid off and furloughed employees in recent weeks, as have other VC-backed companies in real estate, including WeWork, Lyric and Sonder.</p>
<p>On the podcast, Reffkin predicted the residential market is likely to bounce back as early as this summer. He said that he personally made two offers on property last week. “I know the buildings, I know the neighborhood,” he said.</p>

<h3 id="the-compass-center-is-going-remote">The Compass Center is going remote</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.keloland.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/103/2018/01/the-compass-center.tmb-625x350-cr_51878264_ver1.0.jpg?w=625&amp;h=350&amp;crop=1&amp;resize=1280,720" alt="img">
SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (KELO) — The Compass Center began providing people with crisis intervention, counseling, and advocacy to all who are survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, child sexual abuse and human trafficking in 1975. Their goal remains the same, but how they provide those services has changed within the last month.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has caused a lot of businesses to operate differently and The Compass Center is no exception. The counselors used to see clients face to face at their center, but the organization decided to go remote because of the latest pandemic.</p>
<p>Michelle Trent is a counselor and advocate for The Compass Center. She says the transition was necessary and sensible. The Compass Center has a staff of 12 and they share common spaces.</p>
<p>“So our concern really was if one person gets sick or if one client brings it in and gives that to me, it’s unlikely that I would then not pass it on to the rest of the folks that work with us. So, we really looked at it from a perspective of, ‘how do we continue to provide services over the long run for clients?'” Trent said.</p>
<p>So, they turned to technology. The advocates and counselors now do meetings through videocalls and over the phone.</p>
<p>“Our clients have adjusted really well. I think, in this crazy day and age and with all the stuff going on, I think it’s good to have a place where they feel like things are safe,” Trent said.</p>
<p>If you’re a new client, you can still call The Compass Center’s general number. An advocate will connect you with the services you need.
