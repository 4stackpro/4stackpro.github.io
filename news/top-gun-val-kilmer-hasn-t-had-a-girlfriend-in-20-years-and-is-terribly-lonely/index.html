<h3 id="cher-is-praised-by-ex-val-kilmer-for-supporting-him-through-his-cancer-battle">Cher is praised by ex Val Kilmer for supporting him through his cancer battle</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PRI_148186270_1585773821.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;crop=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
Val Kilmer has praised ex Cher for supporting him through his cancer battle</p>
<p>Cher’s ex Val Kilmer has been praising her for sticking by him through his cancer battle.</p>
<p>The Top Gun star speaks highly of former flame Cher in his new memoir, I’m Your Huckleberry, and reveals how she helped him get through his diagnosis.</p>
<p>The two previously dated in the 80s and Val, 60, was later diagnosed with throat cancer in 2015.</p>
<p>Cher invited him to stay with her during his illness and he recalls how Cher ‘stepped in and stepped up’ to be there for him.</p>
<p>In an excerpt from his new book, published by People, Val recalls one night when Cher had been on hand, after he woke up vomiting blood.</p>
<p>He writes: ‘One night I suddenly awoke vomiting blood that covered the bed like a scene out of The Godfather.</p>
<p>Cher and Val dated back in the 80s and he stayed with her following his cancer diagnosis in 2015 (Picture: Getty)</p>
<p>‘I prayed immediately, then called 911. Then alerted my hostess. Cher stepped in and stepped up. And yet even in my grave condition, I saw her scanning the paramedic, who was Gregory Peck drop-dead handsome. Only in Hollywood, right?</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>‘Despite the fact that I was covered in blood, I caught her eye and bounced my brows like Groucho Marx. Hubba hubba. Cher was bashful to be busted but then couldn’t help laughing out loud at the audacity.’</p>
<p>Val continues: ‘Here we were, joking about beauty and desire, while I looked like a stunt man from Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs and, yes, while my life seemed to be in mortal danger.</p>
<p>‘We laughed out loud before they finished with my vitals and shut me up with an oxygen mask.’</p>
<p>Val reveals in his memoir that he is ‘grateful’ to be cancer free for four years now, after fearing he could lose his voice and undergoing a tracheotomy, chemotherapy and radiation.</p>
<p>He is set to reprise his role as Admiral Tom Iceman Kazansky in the new Top Gun movie, Top Gun: Maverick, which is due to hit the big screen in July later this year in the UK.</p>
<p>So far, the movie hasn’t been delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic, despite many other new releases, including new James Bond movie No Time To Die, being postponed to much later in the year.</p>
<p>Kilmer and Tom Cruise are both back for new Top Gun movie Top Gun: Maverick (Picture: Paramount/Kobal/REX)</p>
<p>Tom Cruise is also returning in Top Gun: Maverick and will be back as Pete Maverick Mitchell, who he teases will be doing things that have ‘never been done’ this time round.</p>
<p>‘We just started talking and I realised that there were things that we could accomplish cinematically,’ he told Empire.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>‘I said to the studio, “You don’t know how hard this movie’s going to be.” No-one’s ever done this before.’</p>
<p>Top Gun was first released way back in 1986 and speaking about Cruise and Kilmer bother returning for the sequel, director Joseph Kosinski has said: ‘</p>
<p>‘The rivalry and relationship between Iceman and Maverick is one of those things that makes that first film so iconic.’</p>
<p>He told Entertainment Weekly: ‘It’s a relationship that is important to the Top Gun franchise and as a fan I would want to see how it’s evolved.’</p>

Giphy</p>
<p>As with any actor that makes it big, there are usually a couple of roles along the way that really define a career. For Kilmer, there were a couple of roles that really allowed him to reach the top of the Hollywood elite at the time.</p>
<p>Back in 1986, he was part of one of the most famous movies of all time in Top Gun. In which he played Tom &ldquo;Iceman&rdquo; Kazansky. He then went on to play Jim Morrison in a biopic titled &ldquo;The Doors&rdquo; in 1991. In 1995 he became Bruce Wayne/Batman for Batman Forever. From there though things kind of came downhill.
