WWE</p>
<p>This weekend&rsquo;s WrestleMania is going to look a lot different than what you&rsquo;re typically used to seeing from the biggest wrestling event of the year. Instead of taking place at the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, which is what was originally planned, the 36th edition of WrestleMania will instead go down at the WWE Performance Center training facility in front of no fans &ndash; a first in WWE history. WrestleMania 36 will also take place over two nights (Saturday and Sunday) instead of the usual one-night spectacular.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s weird as hell. There are a lot of questions surrounding WrestleMania 36. Many pundits have criticized WWE for putting the event on at all, calling it a health risk. In an age of social distancing, watching between two and six people grapple with one another will be jarring for some. But as noted, much of it has reportedly already been filmed. So at this point, it only makes sense to try and enjoy it.</p>
<p>Whether that&rsquo;ll be possible, with no crowd for the wrestlers to perform to, is another question.</p>
<p>The main event of the show is Brock Lesnar defending his WWE Championship against Royal Rumble winner Drew McIntyre. Normally I&rsquo;d say this would be a surefire great match, but, as you&rsquo;re no doubt tired of hearing, it&rsquo;s not normal times. Elsewhere, John Cena returns to face Bray &ldquo;The Fiend&rdquo; Wyatt and The Undertaker rises to face AJ Styles.</p>
<p>Perhaps the wildest element of this WrestleMania is that Roman Reigns was scheduled to face Goldberg for the Universal Championship, but pulled out of the match. Instead, the WCW legend will defend his title against Braun Strowman.</p>
<p>Start times</p>
<p>WrestleMania 36 takes place in WWE&rsquo;s Orlando, Florida-based Performance Center on Saturday, April 4 and Sunday, April 5. The main card starts both days at 7 p.m. ET (4 p.m. PT). If you&rsquo;re a WWE Network subscriber &ndash; at $9.99 a month, but free for one month for new subscribers &ndash; you can watch WWE WrestleMania live for free. Otherwise, if you are looking for how to watch WrestleMania, you&rsquo;ll need to contact your local cable provider and pay a separate fee to watch.</p>
<p>Viewers in the UK will have to stay up late to watch WWE WrestleMania, as the WWE performance starts midnight Sunday and Monday. WrestleMania starts for Australians at 9 a.m. AEDT time on Sunday and Monday.</p>
<p>Match Card</p>
<p>WWE Championship: Brock Lesnar (c) vs. Drew McIntyre.</p>
<p>Universal Championship: Goldberg (c) vs. Braun Strowman.</p>
<p>Raw Women&rsquo;s Championship: Becky Lynch (c) vs. Shayna Baszler.</p>
<p>Firefly Funhouse match: John Cena vs. Bray Wyatt.</p>
<p>Edge vs. Randy Orton.</p>
<p>Boneyard match: The Undertaker vs. AJ Styles.</p>
<p>NXT Women&rsquo;s Championship: Rhea Ripley (c) vs. Charlotte Flair.</p>
<p>Kevin Owens vs. Seth Rollins.</p>
<p>Intercontinental Championship: Sami Zayn (c) vs. Daniel Bryan.</p>
<p>SmackDown Women&rsquo;s Championship: Bayley (c) vs. Lacey Evans vs. Naomi vs. Sasha Banks vs. Tamina.</p>
<p>SmackDown Tag Team Championships ladder match: The Miz and John Morrison (c) vs. The New Day vs. The Usos.</p>
<p>Raw Tag Team Championships: The Street Profits (c) vs. Angel Garza and Austin Theory.</p>
<p>Elias vs. Baron Corbin.</p>
<p>Women&rsquo;s Tag Team Championships: The Kabuki Warriors vs. Nikki Cross and Alexa Bliss.</p>
<p>Otis vs. Dolph Ziggler.</p>
<p>Aleister Black vs. Bobby Lashley.</p>
<p>Yep, that&rsquo;s a lot of matches. We don&rsquo;t yet know which matches will take place on which night.</p>

<h3 id="wwe-wrestlemania-36-odds-best-picks-2020-predictions-from-wrestling-insider-who-nailed-two-royal-rumbles">WWE WrestleMania 36 odds: Best picks, 2020 predictions from wrestling insider who nailed two Royal Rumbles</h3>
<p><img src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2020/03/10/0e4895ce-d148-4588-ba05-f9eed6e4ab6b/thumbnail/1200x675/d7e494490ba772cb07acbffa1628af65/edge-wwe-raw.jpg" alt="img">
With WrestleMania 36 approaching quickly, WWE held its final Raw before the big show on Monday. Paul Heyman cut a promo guaranteeing that Brock Lesnar would take care of Drew McIntyre for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 2020. That match is the main event of a loaded WrestleMania 36 card that will take place at the WWE Performance Center without fans on Saturday and Sunday, April 4 and April 5.</p>
<p>McIntyre is the -400 favorite (risk $400 to win $100), while Lesnar is the +275 underdog in the latest WrestleMania 36 odds. Meanwhile, The Undertaker claims A.J. Styles spent most of his career ducking top competition in smaller promotions, and he&rsquo;s the -600 favorite to win his Boneyard Match over Styles (+350) in the current 2020 WrestleMania odds. You should see the latest WrestleMania 36 picks and WWE predictions from Adam Silverstein before locking in any 2020 WrestleMania picks of your own.</p>
<p>Silverstein has been covering the WWE for CBS Sports since 2015. In 2018, he nailed the winners of each Royal Rumble: Asuka and Shinsuke Nakamura, and then followed that up with another sweep in 2019, calling Seth Rollins and Becky Lynch to win.</p>
<p>Now, he has turned his attention to the WrestleMania 36 card and locked in strong WWE picks. Head to SportsLine to see them.</p>
<p>Top WrestleMania 36 predictions</p>
<p>Silverstein is backing Edge to get the win over Randy Orton as a -325 favorite in a Last Man Standing Match on the 2020 WrestleMania card. Edge and Orton have been feuding ever since Orton attacked Edge at Raw the night after the Royal Rumble. On Monday, Edge called Orton out for coasting after being handpicked for Evolution with Ric Flair, Batista and Triple H, so the energy level on both sides should be high for this matchup between two of the best of their generation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact that this is a stipulation match should give Orton&rsquo;s odds a boost because you could stretch the storyline, possibly until SummerSlam in four months,&rdquo; Silverstein told SportsLine. &ldquo;However, considering how long this angle has already gone and the fact that we don&rsquo;t know whether WWE will even be able to do shows after WrestleMania, you have to go with Edge here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How to make 2020 WrestleMania picks</p>
<p>Silverstein has made the call on every matchup at WrestleMania 36, and he&rsquo;s backing multiple plus-money underdogs who could lead to a substantial return. You can see who they are, and all of his WWE picks, right here.</p>
<p>What are the top WrestleMania 36 picks? And which underdogs should you back? See the latest WrestleMania 2020 odds below and then visit SportsLine now to get the top picks for WrestleMania 36, all from an elite WWE expert who has nailed two Royal Rumbles.</p>
