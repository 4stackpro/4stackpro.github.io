Jennifer Lopez tried to cheer up her 118M Instagram followers on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The 50-year-old Hustlers actress shared three flashback photos where she was posing in a fuzzy pink outfit during a photo shoot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On Wednesday’s we wear pink. Sending you all love,&rsquo; said the mother of two has been in self-isolation in Miami with her fiance Alex Rodriguez.</p>
<p>The good ole days: Jennifer Lopez tried to cheer up her 118M Instagram followers on Wednesday. The 50-year-old Hustlers actress shared three flashback photos where she was posing in a fuzzy pink outfit during a photo shoot</p>
<p>The Bronx native has her highlighted hair worn down and straight while wearing gobs of light pink glam makeup for the camera.</p>
<p>The World Of Dance host is overwhelmed by her hot pink top that appears to be made of feathers.</p>
<p>Hit pink stiletto pumps add to the look, highlighting the former Fly Girl&rsquo;s bare legs.</p>
<p>Jenny gives her best face as she stands and squats during the session.</p>
<p>The shoot was by shutterbug Mary Ellen Matthews and were taken for J-Lo&rsquo;s December appearance on Saturday Night Live.</p>
<p>Cover ready: The Bronx native has her highlighted hair worn down and straight while wearing gobs of light pink glam makeup for the camera</p>
<p>Last month Jenny said she is focusing on her health and the wellness of others as she self-quarantines with Rodriguez in efforts to help quell the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The star said she is &lsquo;stuck at home&rsquo; for the time being as the couple are doing whatever they can to make sure they are not exposed to the respiratory illness.</p>
<p>The shoot was by Mary Ellen Matthews and were taken for J-Lo&rsquo;s December appearance on Saturday Night Live</p>
<p>The beauty&rsquo;s decision to self-isolate comes as health officials have advised people to practice social distancing, in which they limit the amount of people they come into contact with.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We’re all stuck at home right now. I am! Everybody’s quarantined and the world is upside-down and crazy. So we’ve gotta make lemonade out of lemons right now, don’t we?&rsquo; said the Amor Amor Amor singer.</p>
<p>The Marry Me actress is doing whatever she can to keep &lsquo;spirits high&rsquo; in her household - which includes her 12-year-old twins Emme and Max with ex-husband Marc Anthony.</p>
<p>JLo said she’s been placing lots of online orders because she can’t go shopping to make herself &lsquo;happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She added: &lsquo;We have to find ways to focus and work from home, but also finding things to keep our spirits high. I don’t know anything that makes me happier than shopping for a pair of shoes.</p>
<p>Four kids between them: She has two kids and so does A-Rod</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be honest with you? I think there’s a lot of online shopping going on right now. And that’s not to make light of this very serious situation, and the people working very hard to stop it. But we have to stay human and we have to keep our sense of humor in hard times, as well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As more and more people begin to work from home to limit their exposure to other people, Jennifer says she’s using her time alone to &lsquo;develop new projects&rsquo; for when the world &lsquo;bounces back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Speaking to Elle.com, she said: &lsquo;This situation, if we’re lucky enough to be healthy - and if you are, be grateful - but if you’re healthy and home, it’s a real reset button for so many of us.</p>
<p>JLO + AROD PSA: She and A-Rod asked people to stay home with this video shared to social media</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be honest, for me, working from home is reading scripts, developing new projects, even working out and learning new dance routines. Because now, you can use the time to prepare.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At some point, hopefully soon, we’re going to bounce back. We always bounce back. And so we need to use this time to get ready to come back even better.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobody wanted this to happen, but if it has to be this way, you can take advantage of the time and work to get better. But do that work from home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is such a difficult time for everybody. There are so many people who are sick. We just want to contain it and work from home. Even my kids are working from home and they&rsquo;re 12! They’ve got virtual school now, and we’re all home together, which I&rsquo;m really happy about. To me, there&rsquo;s no greater luxury than getting to spend real time with my kids.&rsquo;

<h3 id="jennifer-lopez-flaunts-her-toned-legs-in-a-hot-pink-mini-dress">Jennifer Lopez Flaunts Her Toned Legs In A Hot Pink Mini Dress</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jennifer-Lopez-2.jpg" alt="img">
JLo sizzled in a tiny fuchsia mini dress covered in feathers.</p>
<p>Jennifer Lopez proudly showed off her long, toned legs in a series of new photos shared to her Instagram account this week. JLo treated her fans to a stunning throwback look at herself during a professional photo shoot prior to the coronavirus lockdown, which showed her in a number of different poses as she embraced her pink side.</p>
<p>The 50-year-old mom of two once again proved she looks years younger than her age in the April 15 upload. She posed in her fuchsia-colored ensemble that had glamorous long sleeves made entirely of thin, fluffy feathers.</p>
<p>The first snap in the three photo upload showed the “Love Don’t Cost A Thing” singer as she crouched down on the white floor in front of a matching all-white background. She paired her bold outfit with matching shiny hot pink heels.</p>
<p>JLo — who recently revealed a bold hair transformation — gazed off into the distance while she posed, proudly showing off her long, tanned legs.</p>
<p>In the second photo, she struck a very similar pose, though that one was taken from the front as she gave the camera a sultry look.</p>
<p>Jennifer stood up to give fans an even better look at her long, tanned legs in the third and final snap. She posed with her right foot in front of her left and wore her long, straight hair flowing down to her waist.</p>
<p>In the caption, the multi-talented star shared a quote from the 2004 Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams movie Mean Girls as she sent her 118.9 million followers some love.</p>
<p>Her fans took to the comments section to give the star a whole lot of love back.</p>
<p>“Yesss queennnnn,” one follower commented, along with several heart emoji.</p>
<p>“You are too beautiful,” added another.</p>
<p>“I swear there isn’t a color that doesn’t look good on you,” a third person wrote, including an emoji with stars for eyes.</p>
<p>The upload has received more than 1.6 million likes in the first 18 hours.</p>
<p>Jennifer didn’t explicitly confirm in the caption when or where the photos were taken, though she did tag some of the team she worked with on the shoot. The tags appeared to confirm the snaps were from a December photo session ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live.</p>
<p>JLo’s been keeping her social media fans entertained with plenty of new and old content amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>She and fiancé Alex Rodriguez most recently gave fans a peak at how they spent Easter in lockdown with their children. The athlete shared a video that showed the family taking part in an Easter egg hunt in their Miami back garden, which was set up by his wife-to-be.
