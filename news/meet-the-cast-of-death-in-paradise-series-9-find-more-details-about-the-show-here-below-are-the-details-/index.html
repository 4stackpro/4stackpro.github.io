<p>Effects of the toxin meant her muscles would have been paralysed almost immediately, including her lungs and she wouldn’t have made it to the pool herself. It was revealed the killer had moved Valerie’s body to the pool, but taking to Reddit, one fan wondered how the autopsy could have read she had water in her lungs. User and_yet_another_user asked: “So if her lungs stopped working, causing her to die in her bed, how was there any water in her lungs?” They also added the explanation of drowning from Wikipedia, which read: “Forensic pathology states that the presence of water in the lungs is a sign that the person was alive when they entered the water, and the absence of water indicates dry drowning or death before immersion. For dry drowning, they would still have to be alive at the time of immersion.” DON&rsquo;T MISS&hellip;</p>

<p>A flurry of fans resounded to the plot hole claim, with one writing: “Heh, well that&rsquo;s a very good point. I assume the writer didn&rsquo;t check or assumed that the lungs would fill up with water if submerged. I know I would.” Another added: “Very good point! I always assumed the water had entered her lungs after death.” Whilst a third commented: “Never noticed that! Good spot.” It was revealed by the end of the episode Valerie’s body had been dumped in the swimming pool by Dr Anna Jones (Emma Pierson) after her victim overheard the truth about her criminal enterprise.</p>
