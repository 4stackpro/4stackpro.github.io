<p>Much loved comedian Peter Kay returned to our screens last night after years out of the spotlight.</p>
<p>The Bolton-born funny-man was part of a line up of stars for the BBC&rsquo;s The Big Night In fundraising spectacle which saw Comic Relief and Children in Need join forces to raise money for frontline workers - while providing the nation with some much needed entertainment.</p>
<p>During his appearance, the comedian recreated his famous music video for Tony Christie&rsquo;s (Is This the Way to) Amarillo, with the help of the public.</p>
<p>Viewers were delighted to see the star&rsquo;s return to the spotlight after he was forced to cancel his £40million tour back in December 2017 amid &lsquo;unforeseen family circumstances&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Last night&rsquo;s return was Kay&rsquo;s first appearance on the small screen in two long years, reports The Mirror.</p>
<p>But where has the comedian been during his retreat from the limelight?</p>
<p>Charity work seems to have been a main priority for Peter Kay.</p>
<p>After axing his tour and all other work indefinitely just days after appearing on Strictly Come Dancing, his disappearance was immediate and his Twitter page was plunged into silence.</p>
<p>Worried fans wondered what had happened to their comedy favourite - who has since been hit by three cruel death hoaxes.</p>
<p>And they went wild when Peter returned to social media in March 2018 to announce a charity screening of Peter Kay&rsquo;s Car Share.</p>
<p>The event was held to raise cash for The Lily Foundation, which helps children with mitochondrial ­disease, and in a moving blog post he told how he had &lsquo;first hand&rsquo; experience of the charity&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>(Image: Big Night In/BBC One)</p>
<p>The star then disappeared for an entire year, reportedly retreating to his bolthole in Tipperary, Ireland, where locals claimed he seemed determined to fly under the radar.</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s mum Deirdre hails from Coalisland in Co Tyrone, and in November 2017 the notoriously private star opened up about his secluded second home, telling The Late Late Show: &ldquo;I don’t talk about it because I don’t want it to get robbed. We&rsquo;ve had a house here for 12 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We come here all the time. Whenever there’s a school holiday, really. We give Christmas a miss because the house is freezing. It takes ages to warm up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite Car Share winning the best comedy gong at the NTA&rsquo;s in January 2019, Peter didn&rsquo;t attend and left his co-star Sian Gibson to collect the award on their behalf.</p>
<p>Handing out the award to Sian, Peter&rsquo;s Phoenix Night&rsquo;s co-star Paddy McGuinness joked: &ldquo;Where is he? Where is he?&quot;, prompting Sian to reveal he was, &ldquo;watching from home with a cup of tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The actress - whose character Kayleigh Kitson fell for supermarket manager John Redmond (Peter Kay) on their daily commute - did, however, confirm they were working on new projects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have got things that we are going to do together,” she told the Daily Star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously I like to do my own stuff as well and hopefully the two can carry on.”</p>
<p>Then in April 2019 Peter finally surfaced, making a surprise appearance at a screening of Car Share at Blackpool Opera House for The Lily Foundation, with organisers revealing he raised a staggering £34,000 in the process.</p>
<p>Charity founder Liz Curtis - whose daughter Lily tragically died from the condition when she was eight months old - said: &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t thank Peter and his team enough for this incredibly generous donation. For a small charity like ours this is a very significant sum.</p>
<p>(Image: BBC)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I speak for all our families in thanking Peter from the bottom of our hearts. He&rsquo;s shown once again what a real star he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While in the town, Peter also treated himself to a trip on the town&rsquo;s trams, happily posing for a picture with staff.</p>
<p>A post shared to the company account joked: &ldquo;We do love a celebrity passenger on our tours, when we can&rsquo;t get one @ PeterKay_co_uk will do instead!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He kindly allowed a a photo with the driver and conductor on Boat 600 this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dipping his toe back into showbiz, he was pictured backstage at the Peter Pan panto in Crewe and Nativity! The Musical in London on December 29, with director Debbie Isitt sharing the snap on social media.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So lovely to see the brilliant comic genius Peter Kay and his lovely family @nativityuk tonight for our final show!&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;What a lovely surprise for us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came the news fans had been waiting for.</p>
<p>This February, he announced his comeback, unveiling plans to host six Dance For Life shows in London, Liverpool and Manchester for Cancer Research UK this April.</p>
<p>Sadly, the dates have since been postponed amid the coronavirus crisis, but Peter has promised the shows will be back, bigger than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay safe and look after yourselves and the people around you.&rdquo;

<h3 id="peter-kay-is-recreating-his-amarillo-video-after-15-years">Peter Kay is recreating his Amarillo video after 15 years</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article16411376.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Phoenix-Nights-funnyman-Peter-Kay-made-a-surprise-appearance-at-a-charity-bash-at-the-Lowry-Hotel.jpg" alt="img">
Peter Kay is recreating his smash hit music video for Amarillo for the BBC&rsquo;s Big Night In and is calling on all fans - and key workers - to join in.</p>
<p>The Bolton-born comedian shot to the top of the charts 15 years ago with a charity re-release of Tony Christie&rsquo;s (Is This The Way To) Amarillo.</p>
<p>The 2005 music video featured some of the most famous faces on British television, including Michael Parkinson and Ronnie Corbett, raising money for Comic Relief.</p>
<p>Now, Peter is making a new version for the BBC&rsquo;s Big Night In - a special night of television to celebrate unsung heroes and raise money for vulnerable people during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The funnyman is asking fans and key workers to get involved and send in their own clips to be included.</p>
<p>All people have to do is film themselves stomping along to the original track and upload the footage to social media with the tag # BigNightInAmarillo.</p>
<p>On Thursday, April 23, participants might get to see themselves on screen.</p>
<p>A post on Peter Kay&rsquo;s Facebook page said: &ldquo;Calling all Peter Kay fans and all you fabulous key wokers!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter is recreating his iconic Comic Relief music video to Tony Christie’s smash hit, “(Is This The Way To) Amarillo” and this time he wants to include you!</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in aid of the BBC’s Big Night In, Peter wants you stomping along to the original track to show your support for the night of fundraising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be in with a chance of making it into his final video, we’re looking for people to film themselves marching and dancing to the original track (filmed landscape) and to upload the footage onto social media, tagging the clip with #BigNightInAmarillo</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then on 23rd April, you may well see your contribution on the live show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Children in Need and Comic Relief have joined forces to make the show happen - it promises to cheer people up, featuring other comedy greats like Catherine Tate and Lenny Henry, along with music from Gary Barlow.</p>
<p>Charlotte Moore, Director of BBC Content, says: &ldquo;BBC One will bring the nation together for this special one off live charity event.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to thank both BBC Children in Need and Comic Relief for joining forces in these unprecedented times to provide their support to local charities, projects and programmes across the whole UK; and to all of the stars taking part in this unmissable night of entertainment when the country needs it most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Big Night In is airing live on Thursday at 7pm on BBC One.</p>

She hears tales of Chuck Berry at The Boys of Ballisodare Festival in Sligo in 1981; and the famous events in Lisdoonvarna, Co Clare, that ran from 1978 to &lsquo;83. Onwards into the modern era, the Féile festival in Tipperary gradually gave way to Witness (later Oxegen), and the current biggie Electric Picnic. Contributors include Philip King, Tom Dunne, and Fiachna Ó Braonái.</p>
<p>Hubble: The Wonders of Space Revealed</p>

We&rsquo;ll also see Paddy McGuinness, the fellow Bolton-born entertainer who Kay helped get on the fame ladder through bringing him on shows such as Phoenix Nights and Max and Paddy&rsquo;s Road to Nowhere.
