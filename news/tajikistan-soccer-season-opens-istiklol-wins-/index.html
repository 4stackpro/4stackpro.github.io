DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) — Tajikistan started a new soccer season on Saturday, joining a small group of countries around the world where play has continued despite the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Istiklol Dushanbe retained the Central Asian nation’s season-opening Super Cup on Saturday with a come-from-behind 2-1 win over Khujand.</p>
<p>The game was played without fans due to precautions regarding the virus pandemic. A large banner reading “stop coronavirus” in Tajik and Russian covered part of the stands.</p>
<p>Players and staff from both teams mingled freely after the final whistle before officials hung medals around their necks and shook their hands.</p>
<p>Professional soccer is only continuing in a few countries around the world, with Belarus, Nicaragua and Burundi among the holdouts, attracting interest from foreign fans and international gambling markets.</p>
<p>The attention isn&rsquo;t always welcome. An amateur club in Sweden complained of death threats after a practice game was given a high profile on gambling sites.</p>
<p>Tajikistan has not reported any cases of the new coronavirus, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>Istiklol won the Super Cup for the third straight time, matching the record streaks the same club set in 2012 and 2016.</p>
<p>“The guys went out and did their job honestly and won the cup, thanks to them for that,” Istiklol coach Vitaly Levchenko said in televised comments.</p>
<p>Khujand took a surprise early lead against Istiklol, which is the defending champion in the Tajik league. Uzbek winger Sanjar Rikhsiboev beat the Istiklol goalkeeper to a high ball and prodded it in for the lead in the second minute.</p>
<p>Khujand missed chances to extend its lead late in the first half before Istiklol gradually took control of the game after the break. Tenacious Khujand defending preserved the lead until Istiklol scored twice in as many minutes to take the win.</p>
<p>Manuchehr Jalilov leveled the score in the 78th after the Khujand defense failed to clear a cross, and then Muhammadjon Rakhimov chested down a high ball before knocking it past the goalkeeper in the 80th.</p>
<p>Tajikistan&rsquo;s top league starts games on Sunday. The national soccer federation has said those games will also be held without fans until further notice, following recommendations from the Health Ministry.</p>
<p>The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.</p>

<h3 id="despite-zero-reported-cases-coronavirus-on-everyones-mind-in-tajikistan">Despite Zero Reported Cases, Coronavirus On Everyone&rsquo;s Mind In Tajikistan</h3>
<p><img src="https://gdb.rferl.org/2FA51930-B6AA-4D42-BF13-788E81F2403F_w1200_r1.jpg" alt="img">
Schools have reopened after the spring holidays and it seems to be business as usual in crowded bazaars and streets in Tajikistan, where authorities haven&rsquo;t reported a single coronavirus infection.</p>
<p>Many Tajiks, however, say the pandemic virus is in the back of everybody&rsquo;s mind and increasingly affecting people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>Face masks have become a familiar sight even in remote villages, although there has been no official order or requirement for people to cover their mouths and noses.</p>
<p>Panic buying that sent food prices skyrocketing overnight in early March has since subsided, after authorities sought to reassure people it has enough supplies to feed everyone in the country of some 9 million people.</p>
<p>Mamlakat, a housewife in the northern city of Khujand, said she is trying to stock up on flour, rice, cooking oil, and other nonperishables. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be certain of anything anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The State Anti-Monopoly Committee and Prosecutor-General&rsquo;s Office set up a task force last month to assess the situation in bazaars and stop private traders from artificially raising prices amid the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>But some price hikes seem to be inevitable.</p>
<p>Bazaars, grocery stores, and roadside stalls were once loaded with relatively cheaper eggs, meat, candies, and other products from Uzbekistan and Iran. But with the border with Uzbekistan closed and greatly diminished trade with Iran &ndash; where the coronavirus has struck particularly hard &ndash; there are naturally fewer such goods in stores or more expensive substitutes on shelves.</p>
<p>Affordable clothes and shoes were being exported from neighboring China and Kyrgyzstan, but those borders are also mainly shut down. Goods from Turkey have fallen victim to restricted international air traffic.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan, a major exporter of flour and wheat to Tajikistan, announced on March 30 that it was temporarily limiting the exports to prioritize them for domestic use.</p>
<p>Migrant Workers</p>
<p>Many Tajik households&rsquo; main concern is the situation in Russia, which hosts hundreds of thousands of migrant workers from the poor Central Asian nation, where unemployment is widespread.</p>
<p>April is normally the prime month for the migrants to leave for Russia, but now they are stuck at home as the savings from the last year have dwindled.</p>
<p>Many migrants express the hope that Russia will not extend its border closure beyond April 30.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, desperate for any income to put food on the table, groups of men are gathering in the so-called workers&rsquo; market in Dushanbe&rsquo;s Sultoni Kabir bazaar, waiting for customers to hire them for temporary jobs.</p>
<p>Murod Sadriddinov, 52, says he arrives in the market at 6 a.m. and waits until late evening every day to get offered a job. Sadriddinov told RFE/RL&rsquo;s Tajik Service that he makes about $6 a day if he&rsquo;s lucky to get chosen to work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want the government to find us a solution, to give us jobs in some factories, some workplaces,&rdquo; said Samandar Sherov, one of the men waiting for random jobs at the bazaar on March 31.</p>
<p>There are reportedly around 20 such labor markets across the country.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Serious&rsquo; Social Crisis</p>
<p>Leading economy expert Hojimuhammad Umarov warns that, if the government doesn&rsquo;t take measures to create jobs, the country could face a &ldquo;serious&rdquo; social crisis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The government must activate factories, invest in creating jobs, and cooperate with the private sector,&rdquo; Umarov told RFE/RL, adding that authorities should act fast.</p>
<p>No stimulus package has been mentioned and no potential alternatives have been promised by authorities for families facing an uncertain future due to the Russian border closure.</p>
<p>Tajikistan was widely criticized for organizing large parades, concerts, and sporting events to celebrate Norouz, the Persian New Year, in March, ignoring World Health Organization (WHO) warnings about large social gatherings.</p>
<p>Even the country&rsquo;s Super Cup soccer final between champions Istiklol and Khujand will be played on April 4 &ndash; despite virtually every soccer league around the world having postponed its season. Curiously, officials have decided the game will be played without fans.​</p>
<p>Thousands In Quarantine</p>
<p>The Tajik Health Ministry insists that, as of April 2, there has not been one confirmed case of the coronavirus infection in the country.</p>
<p>The ministry said that 6,272 people were taken under a mandatory two-week quarantine after arriving in Tajikistan from abroad between February 1 and April 2.</p>
<p>It added that, as of April 2, there were 3,913 people still in quarantine and none of those released had the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Galina Perfilyeva, the head of the WHO office in Dushanbe, said on April 1 that Tajikistan had conducted more than 700 tests and that all had come back negative.</p>
<p>She added that the samples were also sent to laboratories in Britain and Russia to rule out any possible errors being made by local test labs.</p>
<p>Despite the reassurances, some Tajiks are wary of the official account and question if everyone who could possibly have been carrying the virus has been tested.</p>
<p>A doctor at the Dushanbe city hospital rejected suggestions that officials weren&rsquo;t being transparent about the coronavirus in Tajikistan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A coronavirus infection is not something that officials would be able to hide from people for long, as it spreads very quickly,&rdquo; the doctor said on condition of anonymity as he wasn&rsquo;t authorized to speak to the media.</p>
<p>But the official proclamations haven&rsquo;t stopped people from being prepared for the coronavirus to arrive, or from trying to make some money.</p>
<p>Local designers in Dushanbe have begun creating face masks from the traditional colorful &ldquo;adrac&rdquo; fabric as the demand for masks among people soars in one of the 19 countries on Earth where no cases of coronavirus infection have been reported as of April 2.</p>
<p>RFE/RL&rsquo;s Tajik Service contributed to this report.</p>

<h3 id="tajikistan-provides-solace-to-soccer-junkies">Tajikistan provides solace to soccer junkies</h3>
<p><img src="https://eurasianet.org/sites/default/files/styles/article/public/2020-04/91095683_2500943363501766_1497310811536752640_o.jpg?itok=0sMwoT7p" alt="img">
With soccer leagues around the world grounded thanks to the novel coronavirus, action-starved fans are looking to some less well-known contests to break their boredom. This weekend eyes will be on Tajikistan, where serial champions Istiklol, from the capital Dushanbe, take on Khujand in the country’s Super Cup on April 4.</p>
<p>On Twitter some international aficionados are picking Tajik teams to support in the coming months.</p>
<p>Though COVID-19 is rampaging through Central Asia and locking down Tajikistan’s neighbors, the country insists it has no cases of the virus as yet. There are no social distancing measures in place; lavish Nowruz celebrations for the spring equinox took place at the end of March as planned. On April 1, the World Health Organization’s local representative, Galina Perfilyeva, gave Tajikistan a clean bill of health, saying that more than 700 COVID-19 tests produced no positives. She did warn, however, that people should avoid crowds. The Super Cup will be held without spectators in the stands.</p>
<p>Another Tajik sport, basketball, has also attracted the attention of stupefied fans as the only professional basketball league still operating amid the global shutdown.</p>
<p>But for now most attention is on soccer. After the Super Cup, Tajikistan’s 10-team Higher League kicks off on April 5, with fixtures for the first half of the season scheduled up to the end of May. The domestic game is dominated by Istiklol (meaning “independence” in Tajik), which has won the league eight times since 2010.</p>
<p>The well-connected team was founded in 2007 by Rustam Emomali, eldest son of Tajikistan’s long-serving strongman Emomali Rahmon. Rustam Emomali was club captain and its star striker before he hung up his boots in 2012 to become head of the Tajikistan Football Federation. He now juggles that gig with other roles: he is mayor of Dushanbe, a senator in Tajikistan’s upper house of parliament, and rumored to be the top contender for his father’s job.
