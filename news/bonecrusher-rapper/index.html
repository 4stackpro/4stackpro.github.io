<p>It’s always fun to reminisce over forgotten hit songs — whether one-hit wonders or bangers buried under catalogs overflowing with success. But what about the songs that never quite clinch the top spot, or in some cases, generate buzz without hitting the charts at all? In a landscape that has changed so significantly over the past two decades, some tracks have just become lost in the shuffle.</p>
<p>Here at HipHopDX, we’ve compiled a list that pays tribute to some amazing songs you likely forgot even existed — or perhaps have never even heard.</p>
<p>The Madd Rapper f. Eminem – “Stir Crazy” (1999)</p>
<p>﻿</p>
<p>There was a lot to love about the criminally forgotten 1999 LP Tell ‘Em Why U Madd by Bad Boy Producer Deric “D-Dot” Angelettie’s alter-ego Madd Rapper. For starters, it was the official debut of 50 Cent on the song ”How To Rob.” It was also the debut of a young Kanye West, whom D-Dot managed and mentored in his early days (a role which Ye more accurately described as ghost producing for free). The Chicago icon was behind the boards for this Slim Shady era Eminem feature, unbeknownst to many.</p>
<p>Don Trip – “Allen Iverson” (2012)</p>
<p>﻿</p>
<p>Months before appearing on the coveted 2012 XXL Freshmen cover, alongside names like French Montana, Future and Iggy Azalea, Don Trip dropped this Cool &amp; Dre-produced salute to 11-time NBA All-Star Allen Iverson. Interestingly enough, the song was the catalyst for a feud when Don and collaborator Starlito found themselves in a bitter Twitter back and forth with Post Malone five years later. It ensued following comments made during an interview with HipHopDX when the duo was asked about the correlation between ”Allen Iverson” and Malone’s breakout ”White Iverson.”</p>
<p>Dre f. Rick Ross – “Chevy Ridin’ High” (2006)</p>
<p>﻿</p>
<p>Super-producer Dre (one half of Cool &amp; Dre) first made a splash as an artist back in 2006 alongside Rick Ross for this single, which peaked at No. 54 on Billboard’s Hot 100. He didn’t release another single until 2018, and it took until 2019 for him to finally release a larger body of work, Family Ties, a collaboration with Fat Joe.</p>
<p>Tracey Lee f. Pirate &amp; Busta Rhymes – “The After Party (The Theme II)” (1997)</p>
<p>﻿</p>
<p>How Tracey Lee has slipped through the cracks of Hip Hop’s hindsight will forever remain a mystery. This well-aged single, featuring Busta Rhymes, was a bubbling remix to the D-Dot produced original, which spent 32 weeks on Billboard’s Hot 100. His debut album Many Facez also contained one of the last original Biggie guest verses to be released.</p>
<p>Smilez &amp; Southstar – “Tell Me” (2002)</p>
<p>﻿</p>
<p>This single was inescapable in the summer of 2002. It peaked at No. 28 on Billboard’s Hot 100 and spent 16 weeks on the charts — on top of the video being on no less than twice every hour on the hour. Unfortunately for the duo, label issues made their debut LP, Crash The Party, their last. Fun fact: they are both now in real estate, and quite successful.</p>
<p>Rufus Blaq – “Outta Sight” (1998)</p>
<p>﻿</p>
<p>The peak of Rufus Blaq’s commercial success, this was the lead single off of his slept-on debut album Credentials, which also had a joint featuring The LOX worth revisiting. Adding to the song’s popularity, it appeared on the soundtrack for the film Ride, which starred Malik Yoba, the late John Witherspoon and Sticky Fingaz.</p>
<p>Sway &amp; King Tech f. RZA, Tech N9ne, Eminem, Xzibit, Kool G Rap, Jayo Felony, Chino XL, KRS-One, Pharoahe Monche – “The Anthem” (1999)</p>
<p>﻿</p>
<p>Appearing on Sway (host of Sway in the Morning on Shade 45) &amp; King Tech and DJ Revolution’s third collaborative LP This Or That, it’s insane this song seems to have eluded lists of best posse cuts over the years — especially considering some of the matchups never happened again. For example, Eminem and almost everyone on the list except Xzibit and Tech N9ne.</p>
<p>Cool Breeze f. Outkast, Goodie Mob &amp; Witchdoctor – “Watch For The Hook” (1999)</p>
<p>﻿</p>
<p>The problem with large groups is that sometimes history only seems to shine its light on those that make the most noise. In the case of Dungeon Family, Outkast was so huge, and Goodie Mob made such an impact that Cool Breeze got a bit lost in the Hip Hop history shuffle. However, it’s impossible (when prompted) not to remember how hard this Organized Noize-produced single indeed was. It peaked at No. 73 on the Billboard Hot 100 and also propelled his album East Point’s Greatest Hit to No. 23 on the Hot 200.</p>
<p>JT Money f. Solé – “Who Dat” (1999)</p>
<p>﻿</p>
<p>This song was a monster. Not only did it introduce the world to Solé, who later dropped a pretty successful debut album of her own, but it reached No. 1 on the U.S. Rap chart and No. 5 on the Hot 100. His album Pimpin’ on Wax even cracked the top 10 on the Hot 200, which was no small feat for Miami MCs in 1999.</p>
<p>Rhymefest f. Kanye West – “Brand New” (2006)</p>
<p>Rhymefest’s debut album Blue Collar was a definite sleeper, but it was nonetheless a great body of work. This track was a standout — though the tea was that Nick Cannon admittedly wrote a few of Kanye West’s bars on the song. Specifically, “We don’t need to stunt / I make black history every day, I don’t need a month.” It wasn’t a surprising revelation, considering Rhymefest himself wrote for Ye in the past.</p>
<p>Too $hort f. Erick Sermon, MC Breed &amp; Kool Ace – “Buy You Some” (1996)</p>
<p>﻿</p>
<p>This gem appeared on Too $hort’s 10th album, which was supposed to be his last. However, his retirement (like many Hip Hop retirements after his) didn’t last more than a year. This song, in particular, has the distinction of having one of Erick Sermon’s hardest verses — ever.</p>
<p>Gucci Mane f. Young Jeezy – “Icy” (2004)</p>
<p>﻿</p>
<p>Before the unpleasant drama where Gucci Mane killed one of Jeezy’s associates during a home invasion gone wrong, the two t-r-a-p-s-t-ar’s both had their first taste of success with this Zaytoven-produced single.</p>
<p>Lupe Fiasco f. JAY-Z – “Pressure” (2006)</p>
<p>﻿</p>
<p>When many people think of Lupe Fiasco’s debut album Food &amp; Liquor, they think of the Grammy Award-winning single “Daydreamin’” or the seminal classic “Kick Push.” This JAY-Z featured deep cut — which leaked before the album dropped — seems to take a backseat nowadays.</p>
<p>Lord Have Mercy – “Say What Say What” (1998)</p>
<p>When talking about voices that stand out in Hip Hop, few can lay claim to a baritone as distinct as that of former Flipmode Squad affiliate Lord Have Mercy. This banger was meant to be the lead single from his album Thee Ungodly Hour. Unfortunately, he split from the group due to artistic differences with Busta Rhymes and the album subsequently became indefinitely shelved.</p>
<p>Purple Ribbon All-Stars – “Kryptonite” (2005)</p>
<p>﻿</p>
<p>Aside from the lesser-known single “Body Rock,” this stands as the only commercially notable track from the two efforts released by the supergroup (Big Boi, Killer Mike, Sleepy Brown, Konkrete, BlackOwned C-Bone, Rock D and Vonnegutt) via Outkast’s Purple Ribbon Records. The group once included Bubba Sparxxx and Fonzworth Bentley in its original iteration as well.</p>
<p>Archie Eversole f. Bubba Sparxxx – “We Ready” (2002)</p>
<p>This electrically charged song still pops up at sporting events and in commercials from time to time. However, as far as one-hit wonders go, you’d likely be hard-pressed to immediately answer the “who sang this” question at a local trivia night.</p>
<p>Rosco P. Coldchain f. Pharrell – “Delinquent” (2003)</p>
<p>This gem stands as one of Roscoe=’s best-known solo singles. Unfortunately for the Philly MC, politics kept his long-awaited LP Hazardous Life (set to include production from The Neptunes and DJ Premier) shelved. Things got worse in 2008 when he was arrested for a double-murder and incarcerated.</p>
<p>I-20 f. Ludacris &amp; Bone Crusher – “Break Bread” (2004)</p>
<p>﻿</p>
<p>This Lil Jon-produced banger peaked at No. 45 on Billboard’s US Rap/R&amp;B Singles chart — making it the only single on the Disturbing The Peace member’s debut album Self Explanatory to see any major success.</p>
<p>Da Bush Babee f. De La Soul &amp; Mos Def – “The Love Song Remix” (1996)</p>
<p>﻿</p>
<p>The original itself is an absolute classic, but this remix took it to a whole other level by adding 1996-era De La Soul, fresh off of their Stakes Is High LP. There is something else special about this track, which appeared on the group’s sophomore LP Gravity. In essence, it serves as one of the first recorded appearances of Yasiin Bey, formally known as Mos Def (who appeared on three tracks on the album).</p>
<p>Amil f. Memphis Bleek, Beanie Sigel &amp; JAY-Z – “4 Da Fam” (2000)</p>
<p>﻿</p>
<p>Fans definitely didn’t flock to the store to cop Amil’s music, but the commercial blip that was her debut did produce this gem of a track. Beyond featuring prime Bleek and Sigel, it has one of Hov’s more slept on verses. Had Twitter existed in 2000, the revelation that he was expecting a child likely would have been a New Release Friday trending topic.

<h3 id="killer-mike-5-fast-facts-you-need-to-know">&ldquo;Killer Mike: 5 Fast Facts You Need To Know&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Killer-Mike.jpg-e1591044585347.jpg?quality=65&amp;strip=all&amp;w=780" alt="img">
Michael Render, also known as “Killer Mike,” is a Grammy award-winning rapper and activist. The Run the Jewels musician made headlines last Friday after giving an emotional speech urging Atlanta protesters to refrain from vandalizing the city.</p>
<p>Render called for peace during Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms’ news conference while residents took to the streets over the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died at the hands of a white Minneapolis officer. Scores of anti-police brutality riots erupted nationwide following a harrowing video of former officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck for over eight minutes. Chauvin has since been fired and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.</p>
<p>The city’s peaceful demonstrations took a turn for the worst when protesters shattered the windows of CNN’s Headquarters and set a cop car on fire.</p>
<p>Render, the son of an Atlanta cop, empathized with the protesters at first, citing hundreds of years of American policies labeling black people as less than. He then urged them to take their pains and frustrations to the polls.</p>
<p>“It is your duty not to burn your own house down for anger with an enemy,” he expressed. “It is your duty to fortify your own house, so that you may be a house of refuge in times of organization.”</p>
<p>You can watch his full speech here:</p>
<p>Killer Mike – Atlanta – Mayor&rsquo;s Press Conference #georgefloydMichael Render speaking after TI at the Mayor&rsquo;s press conference, following the burning &amp; vandalism after peaceful protest march for #georgefloyd, 20200529. 2020-05-30T01:46:39Z</p>
<p>The roughly eight-minute speech went viral on Twitter with more than 130,000 tweets. LeBron James also shared the speech, calling it a “mandatory listen.”</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know about “Killer Mike” Rendon:</p>
<ol>
<li>Render Is One Half of the Hip-Hop Duo, Run The Jewels, &amp; Has Been Featured on Countless Classic Tracks Like Jay Z’s ‘Poppin’ Tags’ &amp; Bone Crusher’s ‘Never Scared’</li>
</ol>
<p>Render was born on April 20, 1975 in the Adamsville neighborhood of Atlanta. In 1995, he met Antwan Patton, aka Outkast’s Big Boi, while briefly attending Morehouse College.</p>
<p>The aspiring rapper made his first musical debut trading rhymes with Big Boi on “Snappin’ and Trappin” in a guest verse on Outkast’s 2000 quadruple-platinum LP Stankonia. A year later, he landed his first Grammy for his performance on “The Whole World,” the single from Outkast’s 2001 greatest hits collection. Render saw more success in 2003 with his first debut album as “Killer Mike,” reaching gold status through the Recording Industry Association of America.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until 2013 though, that the rapper connected with his current RTJ counterpart, rapper and producer El-P. Render and El-P joined forces to create what is now the popular hip hop subgroup, Run the Jewels.</p>
<p>The rappers recently announced the details of their upcoming Run the Jewels 4 album. The release date is slated for June 5 via Jewel Runners/BMG. The new album will feature guest appearances from Rage Against the Machine’s Zack de La Rocha, Pharrell, 2 Chainz, Queens of the Stone Age’s Josh Homme and Mavis Staples.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Render Views Himself as an Activist First, &amp; a Grammy-Winning Artist Second</li>
</ol>
<p>Render’s emotional commentary on hot-button topics is nothing new. Over the years, the rapper has emerged as an outspoken activist on subjects surrounding social equality, police brutality and systemic racism.</p>
<p>Render has also given lectures on race relations at universities across the country, including Northwestern University, New York University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>The Atlanta native gained national attention on Nov. 24, 2014 when he addressed the grand jury’s decision on the Michael Brown shooting before a show in St. Louis.</p>
<p>In a similar tone to Friday’s dialogue, Render opened the set with a heartfelt speech that later went viral after a fan uploaded the video online.</p>
<p>Killer Mike&rsquo;s pre-show Ferguson Grand Jury speechKiller Mike about an hour and a half after the Ferguson Grand Jury decision. Run The Jewels at the Ready Room, St. Louis, Missouri – 11/25/2014. 2014-11-25T06:50:40Z</p>
<p>He offered his thoughts and prayers to the people peacefully protesting, as well as “the people who could not hold their anger in, because riots are only the language of the unheard.”</p>
<p>3.Render Once Ran as a Write-In Candidate to Become the Representative for the 55th District in the Georgia House of Representatives</p>
<p>In June 2015, Render made his campaign announcement as a write-in candidate through an Instagram post to his more than 110,000 followers, using the slogan “If I win, We Win.”</p>
<p>Five hours later he posted a follow up video saying he didn’t have the necessary paperwork and couldn’t stand as a write-in. Render said his purpose was to raise awareness of the special election and demonstrate that political outsiders can run against established politicians.</p>
<p>His announcement — while short-lived — received some love on both ends, including from fellow Atlanta rap comrade Big Boi, who shared the news on his Facebook page.</p>
<p>4.Render Is the Proud Owner of a Barber Shop</p>
<p>Render opened a barbershop with his wife Shana in November 2011 called “Graffitis SWAG” (Shave, Wash, And Groom).</p>
<p>A lifelong dream, he intended to use the space to “lift up men in the community who are out of work and help move them toward sustainable, lifelong careers,” while giving his employees an “opportunity for real economic elevation.” The Atlanta shop’s interior is littered with artwork honoring historic black leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
<p>As of 2012, Graffitis Swag employed six barbers and cultivated a community gathering space. The barber shop not only hosted events, like the season premiere for The Boondocks, but also served as the setting for several music videos.</p>
<p>5.Render Took His Message to Netflix &amp; Now Hosts His Own Show, ‘Trigger Warning With Killer Mike’</p>
<p>Render is the host of his own Netflix docu-series, “Trigger Warning with Killer Mike.” The six-episode series launched in January 2019 and has an 86 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Trigger Warning, pitched as a funny and provocative experience, explores “taboo” topics surrounding social change, including drugs, gangs, religion and poverty, through amusing yet educational social experiments.</p>
<p>According to a statement from Render, the show is “about examining cultural taboos and giving viewers the space to examine the ‘what ifs’ and ‘why nots ’ that limit how some people move and operate in the world. In six episodes, we explore the human condition using nontraditional approaches.”</p>
<p>Trigger Warning with Killer Mike | Official Trailer [HD] | NetflixWith no due respect, Trigger Warning with Killer Mike launches January 18 on Netflix, taking on the economy, gang culture, religion, education, and more. “‘Trigger Warning’ is about examining cultural taboos and giving viewers the space to examine the ‘what ifs’ and ‘why nots’ that limit how some people move and operate in the world,” said Michael Render, pka Killer Mike. “In six episodes, we explore the human condition using nontraditional approaches.

<p><img src="https://www.nj.com/resizer/K8LwDTXCNFXQDdEyGmcRMlT_jwc=/1280x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CGGK3CVME5D3XOBVZQ234TVYH4.jpg" alt="img">
The Atlanta Falcons started off Saturday morning by tweeting out a hype video at 8 in advance of Sunday night’s game against the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
<p>By noon, after some internet roasting, the Falcons had already deleted the tweet with the video.</p>
<p>Luckily, I saved it on my phone.</p>
<p>date: 2020-06-16T10:35:48+08:00</p>
<p>I can’t post it here but I can tell you about it, in all its glory.</p>
<p>The video features Atlanta rapper BoneCrusher, best known for the 2003 hit “Never Scared” who also hasn’t recorded an actual album — per a quick Google search — since 2007, or a mixtape since 2009.</p>
<p>Buy Eagles tickets: StubHub, SeatGeek</p>
<p>In this hype video — I couldn’t grab if it had an actual title, but let’s call it “Dirty Bird”, which will make sense in a bit — BoneCrusher is wielding what I can best describe as a &hellip; war hammer? Something like this.</p>
<p>As BoneCrusher is rapping, there is a group of individuals dancing behind him, though all are kind of doing their own freestyle? One guy looks like he’s doing the chicken and another guy is just standing there and waving a white towel.</p>
<p>I wrote the down the lyrics for the song.</p>
<p>Now they’re on the internet forever.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p><img src="https://imagez.tmz.com/image/49/16by9/2013/01/18/498eb94c140e53708497d7118813fa24_xl.jpg" alt="img">
EXCLUSIVE</p>
<p>Rapper Bone Crusher wasn&rsquo;t rolling around a Minnesota mall in a motorized cart this week because he&rsquo;s fat &ndash; despite reports to the contrary &ndash; he tells TMZ, he&rsquo;s got a REAL reason for being temporarily handicapped.</p>
<p>Mr. Crusher tells us, he recently underwent serious knee surgery to repair an injury he sustained a few years ago in Germany, when he was performing for U.S. troops stationed abroad &hellip; and stupidly jumped off stage.</p>
<p>Crush &ndash; real name Wayne Hardnett, Jr. &ndash; says he&rsquo;s been rehabbing the knee since the surgery and that&rsquo;s why he had to use the motorized cart. The rapper says he can walk just fine, just not for extended periods of time &hellip; yet.</p>
<p>That said, Crusher &ndash; who currently weighs roughly 360 pounds &ndash; admits the photos that surfaced on the web this week weren&rsquo;t so flattering, telling TMZ, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m definitely trying to lose weight. I want to get myself back down to where I was on &lsquo;Celebrity Fit Club.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crusher says his goal weight is 250, and he&rsquo;s already lost roughly 40 pounds since focusing on his weight again.

<h3 id="bone-crusher-a-hiatus-from-the-music-industry-to-focus-on-fatherhood">&ldquo;Bone Crusher, a hiatus from the music industry to focus on fatherhood&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_2046-1-e1560286666693.png" alt="img">
Grammy-nominated music artist and activist Wayne Hardnett Jr., aka “Bone Crusher” is the father of five children.</p>
<p>Hardnett decided being a father to his kids was more important than being away from them for long spans of time. Shortly after the birth of his two youngest children and the release of his hit single “Neva Scared,” Bone Crusher took a hiatus from making music until they turn ten years old.</p>
<p>How did you create balance for your kids while working in the entertainment industry?</p>
<p>My children grew up in the music business. My kids are well-rounded because they got the chance to experience in a way that most kids don’t. [They also] got the chance to experience a real home and loving environment that I created for them. It made them become better citizens and humans. Not just better children.</p>
<p>What is your parenting style?</p>
<p>I try not to be so overbearing and have an open mind towards what my kids want to do in the future. [I told myself] whenever I had kids I would make sure that if there’s anything they want in life, it’s possible to do it. I like to be encouraging towards my children. I’m firm, but I try my best to make sure I’m not judgmental.</p>
<p>How important is keeping your word with your children?</p>
<p>It’s very important to keep your promises. When I tell them that it’s a go, they know it’s going to happen. That to me means so much because that’s what I was raised on. My Grandpa always told me “if I promise you [then] it’s going to happen. If it’s a maybe then it might not happen.”</p>
<p>What’s one of your fondest memories of your father?</p>
<p>We always would go to Alabama [in] one of his amazing cars. That trip meant so much to me because it was just me and him. My fondest memory [was how] he always supported me in my music career. He always told me “never stop, never quit, stay true to what you are doing and go for it.”</p>
<p>What’s one life lesson that you feel you should’ve been taught in your younger years?</p>
<p>I think kids should know all the shortcomings [and] problems that the family has as they get older. [It makes them] more responsible. When we are kids we see our parents as our idols [or] more messed up. I think people would have better psychological growth if they knew the shortcomings as well as the triumphs.

<h3 id="tv-one-to-air-deadly-dispatch-starring-tamala-jones-dominque-perry-and-rapper-bone-crusher-on-july-28">&ldquo;TV One To Air Deadly Dispatch Starring Tamala Jones, DomiNque Perry and Rapper Bone Crusher On July 28&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.blackfilm.com/read/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Deadly-Dispatch-1.jpg" alt="img">
TV One’s final installment of the network’s chilling slate of LOVE, LIES AND MURDER movies wraps with the gripping and highly anticipated film, DEADLY DISPATCH. The film premieres on Sunday, July 28 at 8 p.m. ET/7C, followed by an encore presentation at 10 p.m. This film concludes TV One’s month-long airings of movies inspired by true crime events.</p>
<p>DEADLY DISPATCH stars Tamala Jones (Castle), DomiNque Perry (Insecure) and Rapper Bone Crusher (ATL). The film chronicles the tragic murder of Shawn (Bone Crusher), a well-liked owner of a struggling taxi company. Tiffany (Jones) is a local salon owner and Shawn’s longtime, high-school best friend who becomes intertwined in the puzzling circumstances surrounding his death. Unsatisfied with the police’s classification of the case being a “robbery gone wrong,” Tiffany becomes suspicious of Shawn’s grieving widow Amber (Perry). Motivated to find out what really happened to her friend that fateful day, Tiffany embarks on a quest that will not only endanger her strained marriage, but her life as well. Will she be able to come to terms with a deep secret shared between her and Shawn while seeking justice?</p>
<p>“Narcissism and the lack of empathy has changed the mentality and perspective of modern society,” said film star Bone Crusher. “This role meant so much to me. I hope this movie can enlighten others to see what narcissism looks like, and how to help prevent this from happening to anyone else.”</p>
<p>DEADLY DISPATCH is written by Sadé Sellers and directed by Morenike Joela, with casting provided by Leah Daniels Butler and George Pierre as casting director. Swirl Films produced the film for TV One, with Eric Tomosunas serving as executive producer and James Seppelfrick, Darien Baldwin and Keith Neal as producers. For TV One, Jason Ryan is the Executive Producer in Charge-of-Production, Donyell McCullough is Senior Director of Talent &amp; Casting, and Brigitte McCray is Senior Vice President of Original Programming and Production.</p>

<h3 id="lil-petes-melancholy-rap-gives-voice-to-a-lesser-known-side-of-san-francisco">&ldquo;Lil Pete&rsquo;s Melancholy Rap Gives Voice to a Lesser-Known Side of San Francisco&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/2/2019/09/Press-Photo-by-Bryan-Berry-4-1020x794.jpg" alt="img">
On Hardaway, Lil Pete takes command of his story for the first time. As someone who shies away from interviews—“A lot of people say I’m a closed-off person. Even though I make music, they don’t know a lot about me,” he admits—the album is a chance for Lil Pete to truly open up. “I’m telling them everything that happened in my life, what I’ve been seeing, what I’m going through now,” he says. “Hardaway is gonna give the fans more of my life and let them share my journey.”</p>
<p>A core part of that journey, naturally, has been Lil Pete’s community. With his Filipino, Mexican, Black and Native American heritage, the rapper identifies deeply with many cultural groups. He describes his neighborhood as “rough”—though he didn’t think so when he was young. But as Lil Pete got older, many of his childhood friends passed away, or ended up in jail.</p>
<p>Living in San Francisco today, Lil Pete recognizes familiar patterns of crime and violence. But rather than feeling distant or discouraged, the rapper views his position as an opportunity to use his music to uplift his neighborhood. “It inspires me to get big in the music industry and give back to the community and help,” he says.</p>
<p>To reach the level of exposure he hopes for, Lil Pete constantly pushes himself to broaden his music taste (A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, Rihanna and PNB Rock are just a few artists he enjoys) and grow his style. He doesn’t want to pigeonhole himself solely as a street rapper, and wants to think bigger: “You know, sometimes rappers&hellip;feel like, &lsquo;Oh, I gotta rap about the streets, I gotta rap about this,'” he says. “But sometimes you don’t, you limiting yourself.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Lil Pete started Public Housin&rsquo;, a record label dedicated to giving opportunity to artists who come from communities like his. And as he continues to grow his following, he hopes to become a mainstream artist—to get even bigger so that he can help other rising artists from his hometown have their break in music too.</p>
<p>“A lot of people get to fame and don&rsquo;t come back, or don&rsquo;t show up for they city. But I feel like that&rsquo;s not right, so I’m always here. I got brothers and sisters out here,” he says.</p>
<p>“I always come back.”
