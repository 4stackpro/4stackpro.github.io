Ben Affleck received a surprise visit on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>The 47-year-old actor&rsquo;s son, Samuel, eight, rode his bike over to his dad&rsquo;s house in Los Angeles to say hi amid the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>Samuel was accompanied by his nanny who brought over some school work for Ben to look at, according to onlookers.</p>
<p>Shocked! Ben Affleck was caught off guard on Saturday when he received a surprise visit from his son, Samuel, eight, when he arrived on his bike</p>
<p>Ben was dressed casually in a light colored T-shirt and a pair of dark trousers.</p>
<p>He appeared surprised as he made his way to his front yard where two Telsa&rsquo;s and one Range Rover was parked.</p>
<p>Samuel also dressed casually fro the bike ride and completed his look with a dark helmet.</p>
<p>Not alone: Samuel was accompanied by his nanny who brought over some school work for Ben to look at, according to onlookers</p>

<p>The father-son appearance comes after the Batman actor was photographed earlier in the day with his new girlfriend, Ana de Armas.</p>
<p>The pair enjoyed a stroll around his Brentwood neighborhood to walk her dog.</p>
<p>Their self-isolating break comes after a source told Us Weekly recently that they were very happy together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ana is very happy with Ben. She loves spending time with him and they have great chemistry and a lot of fun together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ben and Ana first set sparks alight when they were seen vacationing in Cuba together earlier in the year.</p>
<p>The actors first met in November 2019 on the set of their new movie, Deep River.</p>

<p>She shared a series of photos taken by Ben during their vacation, and while not tagging him, he left a cheeky comment: &lsquo;Photo credit pls.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Since then, the Argo and Knives Out stars have been inseparable.</p>
<p>Ben has had quite a few relationships since his split from ex-wife Jennifer Garner in 2015.</p>
<p>The pair wed ten years earlier and continue to amicably co-parent their children, Violet, 14, Seraphina, 11, and Samuel, eight.

<h3 id="ben-affleck-is-raising-money-for-charities-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic">Ben Affleck Is Raising Money For Charities During the Coronavirus Pandemic</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ben-Affleck-Way-Back.jpg" alt="img">
Celebrities have been getting creative with ways to use their platforms during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. People around the world have self-isolated, either at government and medical insistence or of their own volution. Meanwhile, famous people have not stopped entertaining their fans. Celebrities have recorded special videos. Talk show hosts have continued producing their shows remotely. Ben Affleck, for one, has amplified the needs of charitable organizations.</p>

<p>In March, Affleck shared three different charities on his social media platforms, including his plans to donate himself. Affleck has 2.9 million Twitter followers and 4.1 million on Instagram. Here are the causes he’s raising awareness for and the sorts of donations they need. Affleck’s latest movie, The Way Back, also got an early VOD release. You can now watch it at home.</p>
<p>Ben Affleck donated to The Midnight Mission</p>
<p>On March 25, Affleck shared that he’d donated to The Midnight Mission. He also asked his followers to donate too if they could. “The @midnightmission’s meal service lines tripled this past weekend,” Affleck wrote. “If you are able to, please join me in donating.” The donation link is in his Instagram bio too.</p>

<p>The Midnight Mission provides meals to the homeless in Los Angeles. On March 28, The Midnight Mission shared their thanks and wish list for more COVID-19 supplies.</p>
<p>The previous day the Midnight Mission explained how the stay at home orders were impacting the homeless. They are also educating people on safety precautions.</p>

<p>“When ‘Safer at Home’ was ordered, it took away 90% of the places where they could charge their phones, access Wi-Fi, or participate in community events that kept them connected and informed. Groups who used to serve in the streets stopped and many service providers have reduced or stopped their outreach and other services. The Midnight Mission Staff and Program Participants created this banner to connect with and inform our neighbors of the precautions they must take to stay well.”</p>
<p>Ben Affleck also endorses Robin Hood and Tipping Point</p>
<p>On March 28, Affleck retweeted writer Yashar Ali’s tweet from March 19. Ali asked for donations for Robin Hood and Tipping Point. Both anti-poverty organizations pledged to give cash to hourly workers losing income during the business closures. Ali started a GoFundme to raise donations for those organizations to pay hotel, restaurant and bar workers.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some news: I&rsquo;m happy to announce that my friends at @RobinHoodNYC &amp; @tippingpoint have agreed to partner with me to distribute $$ to provide direct cash grants to hourly workers (including tipped workers) in need.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your donations are tax-deductiblehttps://t.co/zUL0XDk1sS — Yashar Ali (@yashar) March 19, 2020</p>
<p>Affleck asked his followers, “If you can, please donate to @yashar’s fund which will directly support hourly workers impacted by the Coronavirus pandemic.”</p>
<p>His pinned tweet is for Feeding America</p>
<p>Affleck pinned a March 14 tweet to his profile. It’s a donation link to the food bank organization Feeding America. The page says $1 can provide 10 meals in their nationwide food banks. Feeding America is still putting together food boxes, while remaining six feet apart.</p>
<p>We want to give a big THANK YOU to our @2harvest staff and their families who came together (at a safe distance of 6-feet apart!) to pack 884 emergency food boxes on Wednesday. pic.twitter.com/JlEDLhPIC4 — Second Harvest Hrtld (@2harvest) March 29, 2020</p>
<p>“During this time, I’m thinking about our most vulnerable – children losing access to meals they rely on, friends and family who are facing job disruptions, the elderly, and low-income families,” Affleck wrote. Join me in supporting @FeedingAmerica.”</p>

<h3 id="ben-affleck--ana-de-armas-really-love-where-their-romance-is-going-theyve-become-very-close">Ben Affleck &amp; Ana de Armas ‘Really Love’ Where Their Romance Is Going: They’ve Become ‘Very Close’</h3>
<p><img src="https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/ben-affleck-ana-de-armas-mega-ftr-2.jpg" alt="img">
From traveling abroad to quarantining together, an insider reveals how Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas feel about all ‘the time’ they’ve spent by each other’s sides!</p>
<p>Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas‘ budding romance is going just as successfully as their PDA photos suggest! With a recent trip to Cuba and Costa Rica, followed by time spent together in Los Angeles amid the coronavirus pandemic, an insider reveals how all this romantic R&amp;R is shaping their relationship. “The time they have been spending together has gotten them very close and they really love where it is all going,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife. Ben and Ana started off as co-workers, who just wrapped filming on their psychological thriller Deep Water in February.</p>
<p>Ben is feeling just as optimistic about his personal life, we’re hearing! “Ben is in one of the best places he’s been in a long time,” our insider continues. The Justice League star has long been fighting alcohol addiction, and completed his most recent stint in rehab in Oct. 2018. Save for a minor slip during Halloween week in 2019, the actor has been focused on co-parenting his three children Violet, 14, Seraphina, 11, and Samuel, 8, with his ex-wife Jennifer Garner. The father has also been on a grind when it comes to his career — Ben’s new sports drama, The Way Back, released on March 6! Now that Ben has found love along the way, our source adds, “It is really cool to see it working out for them [Ben and Ana] both.”</p>
<p>Ben and Ana are even sticking close amid California’s stay-at-home order, which was issued on March 19 to contain the coronavirus. The co-stars couldn’t hide their affection from the paparazzo after leaving Ben’s home and sharing a sweet kiss in an LA neighborhood on March 24. The couple was getting fresh air to walk Ana’s dog, just like they did three days prior (as you can see in the photo below). Notice the way they look at one another!</p>
<p>Ben and Ana first sparked romance rumors with their trip to Havana in early March, where Ana grew up. At the time, it was unclear if the trip was romantic (they’re co-stars, after all). Those questions were put to rest after Ben and Ana were pictured going in for a kiss on a beach stroll in their next destination, Costa Rica, just a few days later!
