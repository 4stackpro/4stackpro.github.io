<p>I’ve been known to miss out on big pop cultural phenomena. Sometimes it’s because I just don’t get it (as was the case with Harry Potter) or because I was jealous (early-aughts Cameron Diaz). Right now I’m refusing to watch Schitt’s Creek, which I know I will one day be into yet can’t help but feel annoyed by. So if you somehow still haven’t seen Parasite, which took home the Oscar for Best Picture and was easily the biggest film of 2019, I get it. But lucky you — the movie is available on Hulu starting today, and what better time to first experience its brilliance than right now?</p>
<p>While it might be easy to write off Parasite because of all the glowing things people said about it, it’s one of those pieces of art that might be even better than people say. Written and directed by Bong Joon-ho, the genius behind dystopian films like Snowpiercer and Okja, Parasite is about the Kims, a lower-class family struggling to make ends meet doing odd jobs. A friend of their eldest son helps him land a gig tutoring the teenage daughter of the wealthy Park family. Once he’s fully enmeshed in the wealthy family’s day-to-day, the son begins to get the rest of his family involved in scamming the Parks through various jobs that they aren’t qualified for.</p>
<p>If you don’t know anything else about the premise of Parasite, you shouldn’t. What transpires is a thrillingly original film experience that really has it all — incredible performances from a stacked cast (although Park So-dam is a real standout), aesthetic perfection, and a suspenseful plot. But what makes Parasite so special is its shrewd take on class warfare. And what felt timely about it in 2019 will feel completely maddening now. I don’t know about you, but I’d rather feel blinding rage at capitalism than bored numbness. Somehow Parasite captures all that and more — a masterpiece that more than deserves every ounce of hype it got.

<h3 id="whats-on-tv-wednesday-parasite-and-modern-family">What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘Parasite’ and ‘Modern Family’</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/08/arts/08tvcol-parasite/08tvcol-parasite-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
What’s Streaming</p>
<p>PARASITE (2019) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon Ho won an armful of Oscars for “Parasite,” a comedic thriller that this year became the first film not in English to earn the Academy Award for best picture. The movie takes aim at social stratification: Set in South Korea, it centers on a poor family whose members begin working for a wealthy one. Their story, first comic, then shocking, involves tutoring, deception and pizza. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called the film “brilliant and deeply unsettling.” She wrote that Bong “creates specific spaces and faces — outer seamlessly meets inner here — that are in service to universal ideas about human dignity, class, life itself.”</p>
<p>THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER (2017) Stream on Netflix; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. For another whirligig story in which a well-off family’s life is upended, see this stylized thriller from the Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos. Nicole Kidman and Colin Farrell star as married doctors whose world is rattled by a young man named Martin (Barry Keoghan), who seeks revenge for an incident that happened years before. Lanthimos “is less interested in moral shock therapy or social criticism than in aesthetic estrangement,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. “‘Sacred Deer’ feels like a dark, opaque bit of folklore transplanted into an off-kilter modern setting.”

<h3 id="hulu-adds-parasite-3-other-bong-joon-ho-films">Hulu adds &lsquo;Parasite,&rsquo; 3 other Bong Joon-ho films</h3>

<p>April 8 (UPI) &ndash; Parasite and three other films from South Korean director Bong Joon-ho are now available to stream on Hulu.</p>
<p>The streaming service added Parasite (2019) and Bong&rsquo;s movies Mother (2009), The Host (2006) and Barking Dogs Never Bite (2000) to its catalogue Wednesday.</p>
<p>Parasite stars Song Kang-ho, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, Jang Hye-jin, Lee Sun-kyun and Cho Yeo-jeong. The film explores greed and class discrimination through the symbiotic relationship between the wealthy Park family and the destitute Kims.</p>
<p>Parasite won four awards at the Oscars in February: Best Picture, Best Director for Bong, Best Original Screenplay and Best International Film. The movie is the first non-English-language film to win Best Picture.</p>
<p>The movie&rsquo;s popularity caused filming locations in Seoul to become unlikely tourist destinations. It also spurred the popularity of jjapaguri, or ram-don, a noodle dish that appears in the film.</p>
<p>Mother is a drama film starring Kim Hye-ja and Won Bin. Kim plays mom to Won Bin&rsquo;s Yoon Do-joon, a teenager with an intellectual disability that is accused of murdering a high school girl.</p>
<p>The Host is a monster movie starring Song Kang-ho, Go Ah-sung, Park Hae-il, Bae Doona and Byun Hee-bong. The film follows a father (Song) and his family as they attempt to rescue his younger daughter (Go) from an amphibious creature.</p>
<p>Barking Dogs Never Bite is Bong&rsquo;s directorial debut and stars Lee Sung-jae and Bae Doona. The movie follows a couple who take extreme measures to rid themselves of a yapping dog in their apartment building.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the full list of what&rsquo;s new on Hulu in April.
