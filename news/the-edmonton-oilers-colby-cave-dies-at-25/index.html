The Edmonton Oilers’ Colby Cave dies at 25</p>
<p>AP, TORONTO</p>
<p>Colby Cave, an excellent teammate whose lone goal for the Edmonton Oilers this season came on an “awesome” rush down the ice, died on Saturday after a brain bleed this week. He was 25.</p>
<p>The NHL club did not say what caused the bleed.</p>
<p>Cave’s agent, Jason Davidson, has said that the condition did not appear linked to COVID-19.</p>

<p>“Our Colby was loved dearly by us, his family and friends, the entire hockey community, and many more,” his family said in a statement.</p>
<p>NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said Cave’s “life and hockey career, though too short, were inspiringly emblematic of the best of our game.”</p>
<p>“Undrafted, but undaunted, Colby was relentless in the pursuit of his hockey dream,” Bettman said.</p>
<p>Cave was was placed in a medically induced coma on Tuesday at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto. He was airlifted to Toronto after being admitted to a hospital in Barrie, Ontario, on Monday. Cave underwent emergency surgery on Tuesday to remove a colloid cyst causing pressure on his brain.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, his wife, Emily, posted an emotional update:</p>
<p>“We need a miracle,” she wrote on Instagram. “Colby’s parents and myself, got to see him through a window and talk to him with a walkie talkie last night. We are no longer allowed to be in the hospital because COVID-19 rules. We have no idea when we will be allowed to see him again.”</p>
<p>“The nurse has tied his wedding band to his ankle. I am dreaming of being able to touch you, hear your voice, squeeze your hand (3 times), and kiss you again. I love you so much, and my heart is shattered into a million pieces without my best friend,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Cave scored once in 11 appearances with Edmonton this season. He had 11 goals and 23 points in 44 games with the American Hockey League’s (AHL) Bakersfield Condors.</p>
<p>“Colby was a terrific teammate with great character, admired and liked everywhere he played,” Oilers chairman Bob Nicholson and general manager Ken Holland said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>The Oilers posted Cave’s goal on Twitter this week — an impressive rush down the right wing in which he beat a Pittsburgh defender and stuffed the puck past Penguins goaltender Matt Murray.</p>
<p>“Colby is an awesome person who scored an awesome goal for us this season,” the team said.</p>
<p>Cave had four goals and five assists over 67 NHL games with the Boston Bruins and Edmonton.</p>
<p>Boston forward Jake DeBrusk played with Cave in the Western Hockey League (WHL) and again in the Bruins organization.</p>
<p>“I was lucky to play junior hockey with Colby,” DeBrusk said on social media. “He was our captain and leader. It was an unforgettable moment when we again played together in the NHL for the Boston Bruins.”</p>
<p>Cave played five seasons with the WHL’s Swift Current Broncos before joining the Bruins’ organization for the 2014-2015 season after going undrafted. The Oilers claimed Cave off waivers on Jan. 15 last year.</p>
<p>The 185cm, 90kg Cave made his NHL debut with Boston on Dec. 21, 2017, after getting called up from Providence of the AHL. He played three games with Boston that season.</p>
<p>Mark Lamb, Cave’s coach and general manager at Swift Current, recalled an “infectious smile” and a “great person to be around.” “He was just an all-around player,” Lamb said from his home in Prince George, British Columbia, on Saturday. “And probably if he wasn’t the best two-way player in the league, he was right there.”

<h3 id="edmonton-oilers-colby-cave-mourned-by-hockey-world">Edmonton Oilers’ Colby Cave mourned by hockey world</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.dailybreeze.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0412_SPO_LDN-L-NHL-NOTE-1.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=812" alt="img">
The tight-knit hockey community mourned the death Saturday of Colby Cave, a 25-year-old member of the Edmonton Oilers’ organization who spent most of the 2019-20 season with the Bakersfield Condors of the American Hockey League. The Oilers confirmed his death from a brain bleed suffered earlier in the week.</p>
<p>“It is with great sadness to share the news that our Colby Cave passed away early this morning,” his wife, Emily, posted on social media. “Both our families are in shock, but know our Colby was loved dearly by us, his family and friends, the entire hockey community and many more. We thank everyone for their prayers during this difficult time.”</p>
<p>Condolences and messages of sadness came from near and far, from Wayne Gretzky and commissioner Gary Bettman, from Cave’s teammates past and present, and from clubs around the NHL and the AHL.</p>
<p>Cave, a center, played 67 games with the Oilers and Boston Bruins in his NHL career.</p>
<p>“Janet and I are so sad to hear of Colby’s passing,” Gretzky wrote on Twitter, referring to his wife. “He was a wonderful hockey player with a bright future, but an even better person. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Emily and his entire family.”</p>
<p>Bettman praised Cave’s determination to make it to the NHL after he was undrafted, signing with the Bruins on April 7, 2015. Cave made his NHL debut with the Bruins on Dec. 21, 2017. The Oilers claimed him off waivers Jan. 15, 2019.</p>
<p>“The National Hockey League family mourns the heartbreaking passing of Colby Cave, whose life and hockey career, though too short, were inspiringly emblematic of the best of our game,” Bettman said in a statement. “Undrafted but undaunted, Colby was relentless in the pursuit of his hockey dream with both the Edmonton Oilers and Boston Bruins organizations.</p>
<p>“An earnest and hardworking player, he was admired by his teammates and coaches. More important, he was a warm and generous person who was well-liked by all those fortunate enough to know him. We send our heartfelt condolences to his wife Emily, their families and Colby’s countless friends throughout the hockey world.”</p>
<p>Cave, a native of Battleford, Saskatchewan, was hospitalized earlier in the week and underwent surgery to remove a colloid cyst that caused bleeding on his brain. He was placed in a medically induced coma, but did not awake. His death was not COVID-19 related, his agent said.</p>
<p>“Heavy heart today,” Oilers captain Connor McDavid said on Twitter. “You were an amazing person and always brought so much energy and positivity into the room and people’s lives. You will be deeply missed Caver. Sending all my love to Emily and the entire Cave family.”</p>
<p>Boston forward Jake DeBrusk was Cave’s teammate in junior hockey and also with the Bruins.</p>
<p>“I’m so shocked and saddened to hear this horrible news,” DeBrusk wrote on social media. “I was lucky to play junior hockey with Colby. He was our captain and our leader. It was an unforgettable moment when we again played together in the NHL for the Boston Bruins.</p>
<p>“He was an amazing person, player and friend. Sending my deepest condolences to Emily and the Cave Family. Rest in peace Colby.”</p>
<p>KINGS SIGN HULTS</p>
<p>The Kings signed defenseman Cole Hults to a two-year, $1.85-million entry-level contract. Hults, the Kings’ fifth-round draft pick in 2017 (134th overall), scored a career-high eight goals and tied his career best with 22 assists as a junior at Penn State this past season.</p>
<p>Hults, 21, had 17 goals and 61 assists in 111 games while leading Penn State to its first NCAA tournament appearances in 2017 and ’18. The Nittany Lions were the Big Ten’s regular-season champions this past season.
