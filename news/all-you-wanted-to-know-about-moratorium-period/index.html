With the country being in lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19, the Reserve Bank of India had announced a slew of measures last week, to tide over the economic fallouts. Among other measures, one measure that has brought a lot of cheer is the RBI allowing banks to grant a three months moratorium to their borrowers for term loans outstanding as on March 1, 2020.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>A moratorium period, the technical term for a repayment holiday, is basically a length of time during which a borrower gets time-off from his or her loan repayments. That is, you as a borrower need not start paying your instalments or interest dues if you are granted a moratorium. As per RBI’s announcement, borrowers stand to get a repayment holiday from loan dues for three months from March 1 to May 31, 2020. The RBI has allowed banks and other lenders to decide how they will structure this deferment. This includes all kinds of loans including personal and credit card dues.</p>
<p>Why is it important?</p>
<p>Moratorium period effectively allows a borrower to postpone repayment of liabilities and help in planning his/her finances better. As a practice, banks and other financial institutions offer moratoriums to students taking education loans. As there might be a time lag between students completing their studies and getting a job, student loans usually a built-in provision for repayment holiday.</p>
<p>Similarly, some lenders offer moratoriums on home loans as well. For instance, SBI’s flexi home loan allows customer to pay only interest in the initial 3-5 years, after which flexible EMI payments begin. But in the current situation, banks are allowed to offer moratoriums on all kinds of loans for three months, without any such delay or default counting as a default or bad loan. Similarly, if you are running a business, in respect of working capital facilities, lending institutions are permitted to defer the recovery of interest applied (cash credit/overdraft) for this moratorium period.</p>
<p>While such repayment holidays are offered to give relief to the borrower, they come with a downside as well. Let’s consider the case of the current moratorium. While borrowers are not required to pay EMIs or interest till the end of moratorium period, the interest will continue to accrue on their loan amounts. Effectively, folks who avail of the moratorium will end up paying extra interest to the bank.</p>
<p>Why should I care?</p>
<p>If you are among the individuals whose income has taken a hit due to the virus outbreak and the impact of the lockdown, then the moratorium may be a godsend. Your non-payment of interest or principal amounts during these three months will not be considered as a defaults and will not affect your CIBIL score. However, the interest accrued during this period can come back to pinch your pocket when the moratorium ends. The interest can be particularly high for personal loans and credit cards.</p>
<p>Consider a loan of ₹5 lakh at an interest of 12 per cent per annum for a tenure of five years. Over the five-year term, the EMI on this loan works out to ₹11,122 and the interest payable works out to ₹1.67 lakh, taking your total dues to ₹6.67 lakh. But if you avail of a three-month moratorium, your EMI rises to ₹11,459 and you end up paying ₹6.87 lakh to the bank, after accounting for the longer tenure due to the moratorium period. However, borrowers need to check with their bank on the exact interest calculation and other terms and conditions.</p>
<p>The bottomline</p>
<p>Moratorium is only a reprieve and not a waiver. Ultimately, you’ve got to foot the bill.</p>

<p>On March 27, the(RBI) put out a notification permittingand non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) “to grant aof three months on payment of all instalments” of term loans “falling due between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020”.This got the media, in particular the Indian languages media, all excited. But the devil as usual lay in the detail.The RBI notification made it very clear that only if the individual bank or NBFC wanted, did it need to offer a moratorium. From the details available as of now, all banks and NBFCs are offering this facility to their borrowers.In case of most banks and NBFCs, the borrower has to apply for the moratorium and unless that is done, the regular(equated monthly instalment) on thewill be debited from the bank account. The details of how to go about this are available on the individual websites of banks and NBFCs.If you apply for a moratorium it will come with a certain cost attached to it. Let’s try and understand this through an example which is doing the rounds on the social media. The) on its website says: “Impact in case of Home Loan – For a loan of Rs 30 lakhs with a remaining maturity of 15 years, the net additional interest would be approximately Rs 2.34 lakhs equal to 8 EMIs.”Let’s understand this in detail. Let’s say you have taken on a home loan from SBI. The outstanding amount on the home loan is Rs 30 lakhs. Theremaining is 15 years (or 180 months) and the rate of interest being charged is 8.35% (this detail is not there on the SBI website, but something I have assumed).The EMI on this home loan will amount to Rs 29,279. Let’s say you decide to make use of the moratorium. In this case, you will not pay any EMI until May 31. Also, if you have already paid an EMI for the month of March, it will be credited back to your account.At the same time an interest will be charged on the outstanding loan for the period of three months you do not pay any EMIs. At 8.35% on a loan of Rs 30 lakh, this amounts to Rs 62,625 in total. This will be added to your outstanding loan of Rs 30 lakh. In June 2020, when the moratorium ends, the outstanding loan will become Rs 30,62,625. The EMI will continue to remain the same at Rs 29,279. As you repay a higher outstanding loan with the same EMI, the tenure of the loan will go up.In this case, the tenure will go up by 8 instalments(7.7 to be very precise) and the outstanding loan will now be repaid over a period of 15 year 8 months. The extra eight instalments in total amount to around Rs 2.34 lakh.The question is why is this happening i.e. why does the tenure end up growing by 8 months? The reason is very straightforward. By not paying the interest for three months and adding it to the outstanding loan amount, you end up paying interest on interest and that leads to an increase in tenure.In fact, the tenure increases by 8 months irrespective of the outstanding loan amount as long as the outstanding tenure is 15 years and the interest rate is 8.35%. The longer the remaining tenure of your loan, the higher will be the increase in tenure if you opt for the moratorium.Let’s take the other example on the SBI website: “Impact in case of Auto Loan – For a loan of Rs 6 lakhs with a remaining maturity of 54 months, the additional interest payable would be … equal to additional 1.5 EMIs.”The EMI on such a loan at an interest of 9% amounts to Rs 13,554. If you opt for a moratorium, the interest for a period of three months will amount to Rs 13,500. In June 2020, this will push the outstanding amount to Rs 6,13,500. At an EMI of Rs 13,554, the remaining tenure now will be 55.5 months or 1.5 months extra from the original tenure.If outstanding tenures are low, the extra tenure will also be low.The moral of the story is that you should continue paying the EMIs and making use of the moratorium should be the last option you choose.Some people are wondering as to why do banks need to charge an interest for the moratorium period. This is as simple as it gets. Banks borrow from people who have money and lend to people who need it. People who deposit money in a bank are paid a certain rate of interest. Banks pay interest by charging an interest on their loans. If interest on the loans of banks are not repaid, how will the bank ever get around to paying interest on their deposits?Everyone who is suggesting that the banks should not charge an interest under the moratorium need to think about this very basic problem.

<h3 id="why-the-three-month-moratorium-on-your-home-loan-emi-may-not-be-a-good-idea">Why the three-month moratorium on your home loan EMI may not be a good idea</h3>
<p><img src="https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2020-03/20/full/1584724669-8489.jpg" alt="img">
Public sector lenders have swung into action after the allowed all commercial to offer their customers a moratorium of three months on the repayment of term loans. Many have informed their customers about the deferment of EMIs and interest dues to help soften the blow due to the crisis.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why the three-month moratorium on your home or auto loan may not be such a great idea after all:</p>
<p>First, a little background. The moratorium is essentially available to instalments falling due on between March 1 and May 31. Despite this many borrowers were still getting sms reminders to pay their instalments on time. So, in order to make things clear, some public sector have taken to Twitter to announce their moratorium offer for their customers.</p>
<p>However, many lenders also advised borrowers not to make use of the moratorium offer in case they were in a position to pay their instalments on the due date. State Bank of India, the country&rsquo;s largest lender, was one such.</p>
<p>The bank cautioned its customers that deferment of EMIs offered under RBI&rsquo;s relief package could put an additional burden on them while advising borrowers to repay if they had the means. SBI said on its website that deferring EMIs on a thirty-lakh-rupee with a residual maturity of 15 years would entail a net additional interest of approximately Rs 2.34 lakh. A back of the envelope calculation will that the sum worked out to as many as eight EMIs. In other words, if you defer three EMIs on your home loan, you will end up paying eight EMIs more.</p>
<p>has said that the interest will continue to accrue on the principal outstanding for the period of the moratorium at the contracted rate of the loan. The tenure will get extended by the corresponding period for which the moratorium has been availed.</p>
<p>This means, if the EMI for the month of March 2020 has been paid and moratorium for April and May 2020 has been availed, then the loan tenure will be extended by two months. However, since the interest has accrued during the moratorium period, it will get loaded to the EMI at some point, and the borrower will invariably end up paying a higher to service the loan at the contracted rate.</p>
<p>This can be better understood with a small illustration. The instalment on a thirty-lakh-rupee taken for 20 years at nine per cent rate of interest works out to about Rs 26,991. Let&rsquo;s assume you&rsquo;ve serviced the loan for five years already, and need to pay another 180 instalments over 15 years. If you availed the moratorium in totality, and the EMI you would start paying in June would work out to about Rs 27,600. This works us to Rs 608 more per month or Rs 1,09,500 or thereabouts for the residual life of the loan. Your call on whether or not this makes financial sense.</p>
<p>Coming back to the lenders, has extended the term loan repayment period by three months, and has asked customers to contact their respective branches for further details.</p>
<p>has also increased the repayment schedule as well as residual period of the term loan by 3 months due to moratorium. However, interest during the moratorium period will continue to accrue and the recovery of interest on cash credit/overdraft during the period March 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020 (moratorium) deferred and will be recovered after moratorium period.</p>
<p>While had made it clear that the moratorium isn&rsquo;t a concession, has encouraged customers whose incomes have not been impacted to continue payment as per the schedule.
