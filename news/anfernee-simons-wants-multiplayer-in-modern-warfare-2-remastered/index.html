All the emotions resurfaced for this classic game.</p>
<p>Game 7 of last year’s playoffs between the Trail Blazers and Nuggets had a little bit of everything!</p>
<p>And as all the postseason feelings came rushing back, it was fun to relive this comeback win with Rip City Faithful.</p>
<p>This game 7 replay got me reminiscing hard😢 just remember how mad I was after going down 17 points early to being probably the happiest in my life after we stormed back in the 4th. Can’t wait to see us get back to this level of play! #RipCity — 🅕🅞🅡🅣🅗🅔🅕🅐🅝🅢 🎙 (@503Blazerfans) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>I forgot how much Portland struggled during most of the first half in Game 6 at Denver (replay now on Ch 617). Makes the comeback even more impressive. Gutty team last season. Lillard scoreless thru first 18 min. #RipCity pic.twitter.com/mfl5zI3n7e — Chris Barron (@tbc5150) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>forgot that Denver was up by as much as 17 in the first half of game 7 of last year&rsquo;s playoff series. that made this game all the more outstanding in the terms of great Blazer playoff wins #RipCity — Meth Gator (@omnivore) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>If you are a Trail Blazer fan you should be watching this fourth quarter of the Porltand-Denver Game 7 from last season. Zach Collins was terrific, btw. You forget some of this stuff… — Dwight Jaynes (@dwightjaynes) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>This blazer game got me in my feels 😔😔😔 @trailblazers #ripcity — Angel Rodriguez (@Adogg02) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>I know how it ends, but I’m still nervous as hell watching this @trailblazers classic Game 7. 😂 #RipCity — Rain (@petrichoregon) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>Heading into the final game of the series, here is how things played out:</p>
<p>Game 1 Mon. April 29 DENVER 121, Portland 113</p>
<p>Game 2 Wed. May 1 Portland 97, DENVER 90</p>
<p>Game 3 Fri. May 3 PORTLAND 140, Denver 137 (4OT)</p>
<p>Game 4 Sun. May 5 Denver 116, PORTLAND 112</p>
<p>Game 5 Tue. May 7 DENVER 124, Portland 98</p>
<p>Game 6 Thurs. May 9 PORTLAND 119, Denver 108</p>
<p>The win in Denver was in big thanks to CJ McCollum, who posted 37 points and nine rebounds to lead the Trail Blazers to the Western Conference Finals for the first time in 19 years.</p>
<p>McCollum got it done on both ends too.</p>
<p>We can’t forget about that chase-down swat!</p>
<p>Oh my&hellip; that @CJMcCollum chase down block 😳 I’m hype like I don’t know the end result 😄 Let’s go @trailblazers #RipCity — BlazerFanPage (@BlazerFanPage) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>Just a monster momentum play by CJ on that chase-down block. A signature play for him. — Dwight Jaynes (@dwightjaynes) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>Seth made a huge play chasing down Murray . Beautiful set up.</p>
<p>-CJ — Portland Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>The Trail Blazers shooting guard’s crucial chase-down block on Jamal Murray in crunch time helped turn the tide as the Blazers beat the Nuggets 100-96.</p>
<p>McCollum hit the Blazers first three pointer of the game about four minutes into the second quarter. Portland started the game 0-for-10 from deep.</p>
<p>He was the only Blazer scoring at ease early on.</p>
<p>During tonight&rsquo;s replay of the game, The Trail Blazers shooting guard was live-tweeting the second half on the Trail Blazers’ Twitter, because as CJ put it: “The first half was a snoozefest.”</p>
<p>I shall return in the second half . In the meantime I will answer some questions. . The first half was a snooze fest anyway &hellip; pictured below is my daughter Fiona . Aka Fifi aka mini lioness aka Lil mamaaaaa pic.twitter.com/IdLGZ6j7iG — Portland Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>McCollum’s second half play-by-play was as fantastic as his play in Game 7.</p>
<p>Jokic was out there serving. Crazy part about this game is that I always felt like we had a chance even though they was beating the brakes off us lol</p>
<p>-CJ — Portland Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>Enes was huge all playoffs and an underrated pick up for us last year- sidenote good to see hoodie and Zach out there 👀</p>
<p>-CJ — Portland Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>Best players in the world can get to the midrange when they need to. In the playoffs it’s about generating quality shots in one on one situations , half court , transition and pick and roll. Game slows down once you only have to worry about playing one team</p>
<p>-CJ — Portland Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>I remember in the huddle saying cut it to 10 and we got action. We cut it to 3 with 5 mins left. They booties got tight!!</p>
<p>-CJ — Portland Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>Zach a killer . Fearless . Never backs down . Will run through a wall and make the right plays</p>
<p>-CJ — Portland Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>Best part of this ending is that coach asked what we wanted to do. I told him no screen. If they send the double I want to see them running at me. Told em get me the ball and imma get a bucket. Big bro always said get to your spot and live with the result. Got to my spot.</p>
<p>-CJ — Portland Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>The pull-up jumper to put the Blazers up three with just under 12 seconds remaining in the game was just what McCollum wanted – he got to his spot.</p>

<p>-CJ — Portland Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>AND&hellip; McCollum was out there spitting the truth on Twitter as well:</p>
<p>I love when players foul including me and act like they didn’t touch em 🤣. We some liars 🤣</p>
<p>-CJ — Portland Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>Plus, he broke the news that he and his fiancée Elise are officially adopting their puppy that they have been fostering for the last week.</p>
<p>FiFi is ours and no one else can have her — Portland Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>It’s really no surprise this series went to seven games. Denver won the regular season series against Portland in 2018-19, 3-1. All four games were decided by single digits.</p>
<p>And even though it was the CJ McCollum takeover game, Evan Turner was also clutch down the stretch. ET came up big from the free throw line in the final seconds, while scoring 10 of his 14 points for the game in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Turner was fresh after not playing that much in the series, but was given extra minutes after Rodney Hood went out with a knee injury.</p>
<p>CJ deservedly gets most of the love for Game 7 in Denver, but ET was so big in this game, especially down the stretch — Joe Simons (@joesimonssays) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>Never a doubt ET was gonna hit those. Big stones</p>
<p>-CJ — Portland Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>Evan. Turner&rsquo;s. Big. Time. Free. Throws. — chadly boomer gamer the second. 🔴⚪⚫ (@bleedbluegreen3) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>ET had scored just four points in the first six games of the series before his clutch Game 7 performance.</p>
<p>What a night it was! To be heading to the team’s first WCF appearance in 19 years was a pretty overwhelming feeling for all of Portland, but especially for the leader of Rip City, Damian Lillard.</p>
<p>This moment 🥺❤️ pic.twitter.com/QEShgNW7LB — Portland Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>There really were so many great memories from that night. And Meyers Leonard even reminded us what the celebration was like in the locker room.</p>
<p>Crazy game!! Amazing locker room memories post game. The amount of joy was incredible. I also drank a @CoorsLight on camera and loved every second of it. — Meyers Leonard (@MeyersLeonard) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>It was also a nice chance to trash talk Denver Nuggets fans once again:</p>
<p>Taking over the @trailblazers handle now. Wonder what happens in the second half of this game . Been awhile since I watched. Tag a nuggets fan 🤣 — CJ McCollum (@CJMcCollum) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>Just a reminder, as we all learned doing this series, there are no Nuggets fans. They do not exist. https://t.co/qvbcoQxxxD — My Full Name is Michael Francis Acker (@mikeacker) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>Now, here’s to hoping the NBA resumes and the Trail Blazers are given the chance to get back to the playoffs.

<h3 id="call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-remastered-rumored-for-monday-release">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Remastered rumored for Monday release</h3>
<p><img src="https://apptrigger.com/files/2019/05/Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfare-2.jpg" alt="img">
Just a few days after files for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Remastered were discovered, it’s now rumored that the campaign will drop on Monday, March 30.</p>
<p>Following the discovery of files pointing towards a remaster of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, there’s now talk that the campaign could be released as early as Monday, March 30. While we’re still awaiting official announcement from Activision, speculation over the weekend pointed towards a release today.</p>
<p>Prominent Call of Duty leaker Okami was pretty confident when asked about the previously mentioned date of March 30, giving it a “99.9999%” chance (via MP1st). He even pinned the original tweet from March 25 as a double-down that March 30 will be the release of Modern Warfare 2 Remastered.</p>
<p>Files for ads, digital banners and updated cover art for Modern Warfare 2 Remastered were discovered in the latest update for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. The files suggested that only the campaign would be remastered, although dataminers also uncovered files pointing towards new multiplayer maps from MW2 as well.</p>
<p>Nothing official has been announced by Activision yet but that’s not too surprising. There were tons of leaks ahead of the Call of Duty: Warzone‘s launch and Activision kept tight-lipped the entire time. With little to no actual marketing ahead of time — beyond the rumors and word of mount — Activision announced Warzone and dropped it the very next day.</p>
<p>It’s possible they could be taking a similar approach with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Remastered. It’s important to note that this remaster will be only of the campaign and not the entire multiplayer experience, although maps from the game are said to be coming to Modern Warfare.</p>
<p>To be perfectly clear, this is only a rumor and nothing more than that. However, Okami does have a pretty good track record with both the Call of Duty: Warzone leak and the claim that the MW2 remaster won’t be multiplayer (confirmed by datamining).</p>

<p>Ratings boards and leaked ads seem proof enough that Modern Warfare 2 Remastered is at least real. The only question is when it will be announced, when it will release and how much it will cost.

<h3 id="call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-remaster-reportedly-launches-tomorrow">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Remaster Reportedly Launches Tomorrow</h3>
<p><img src="https://sm.ign.com/t/ign_in/news/c/call-of-du/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-remaster-reportedly-launches-t_n73y.1200.jpg" alt="img">
Reports claim that a remastered version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 will launch tomorrow, March 31.</p>
<p>Eurogamer reports that a PlayStation Store listing for the game, which has since been removed, is accurate and that Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered will launch March 31.</p>
<p>The rumours of a remastered MW2 campaign have been long standing and come from several sources. Initially, at least in recent history, it began on Reddit, where a datamine into Modern Warfare Season 3 found details of the then unreleased Call of Duty Warzone, as well as details on a MW2 remaster.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered was rated by a South Korean games rating board, and a Twitter account called Okami - which previously accurately dated Call of Duty Warzone ahead of launch - suggested Modern Warfare was releasing March 30.</p>
<p>While there is no sign of the game so far today, Eurogamer reports that it will be the following day. That report suggests that the remaster has actually been finished for a long period of time, with Activision awaiting the right time to release. If reports are true, then it would appear that Activision considers this time as good as any.</p>
<p>The Modern Warfare 2 remaster allegedly only remasters the campaign of the original game. Multiplayer maps from the 2009 favorite are reportedly set to be added to Modern Warfare (2019).</p>
