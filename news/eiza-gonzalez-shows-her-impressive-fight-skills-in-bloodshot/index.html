Eiza Gonzalez is about to become our new hero with the new unparalleled action-packed film Bloodshot. The movie which also stars Vin Diesel and Sam Heughan has finally been released in digital platforms to enjoy in the comforts of your home and keep you disconnected for a few hours. With model roles in other action films like Baby Driver, Alita: Battle Angel and the upcoming Godzilla vs. Kong, Eiza is about to be crowned as the new action hero of 2020. Sorry, Angelina Jolie!</p>

<p>The Mexican actress was involved in physical training during the production of Bloodshot which involved underwater diving and breathing techniques. We won’t spoil the movie, but the film features military weapons and stunt scenes that will keep you stuck to the screen. Eiza is one of the first Mexican actresses to play a superhero role in Hollywood, wavering the typical Latina stereotype role featured in other movies.</p>
<p>Eiza trained with a baton and learned new fight moves during her stunt training on set. “Here’s some footage of how I learned the whole fight choreography, incredible stunt team, it was fun to learn how to use a baton,” the actress shared with her fans on social media as she is seen practicing her fight moves with her stunt team.

<h3 id="eiza-gonzalez-hopes-bloodshots-early-digital-release-brings-escape-and-excitement-during-pandemic">Eiza Gonzalez Hopes Bloodshot&rsquo;s Early Digital Release Brings &lsquo;Escape and Excitement&rsquo; During Pandemic</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/avTq30LA2Uy_l7xtsubu0Q--~B/aD0xNTAwO3c9MTE1MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/4b463e006007c465b398c7da35820574" alt="img">
Eiza Gonzalez hopes her new movie Bloodshot will bring some comfort to fans worldwide as they practice social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The actress stars alongside Vin Diesel in the thrilling action movie, which didn’t get much play time in theaters as chains across the country closed to help curb the spread of the virus. But with an early release on digital, fans everywhere can watch Gonzalez and Diesel grapple with how technology can have an affect on life — something many might be wondering when the world looks to deal with the repercussions of the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>“I think that throughout these times that we’re all sort of struggling, I find myself trying to find things that bring an escape and excitement,” Gonzalez, 30, tells PEOPLE. “And this movie also makes you think a lot. I mean, it’s really weird the timing of the movie and the subject of the movie with what we’re going through. I think that just makes it way more appealing for people to want to watch it because it kind of talks about the future of humanity — and that’s sort of what we’re all kind of doubting and thinking right now.”</p>

<p>Bloodshot follows as Diesel’s Ray Garrison, a U.S. Marine, suddenly wakes up in a new reality where he’s told he died and was brought back to life as an invincible soldier, able to self-heal from any wound due to special nanite technology implanted in his blood.</p>
<p>He also meets Gonzalez’s KT, a former Navy diver who now breathes through the help of Rising Spirit Tech, the company that brought them back to life.</p>
<p>And much like some of her other roles in action movies, KT ends up being central to saving the plot of the movie.</p>
<p>“She didn’t feel like a damsel in distress but also didn’t feel like an archetype of a bad chick, or people who are called strong female character. Usually those labels stay on that level as a one dimensional character,” Gonzalez explains. “She felt emotional and real and empathetic and sympathetic, but also completely capable and driven to do whatever she needed to do. And she also had a moral compass, which you rarely get to see these three things in one in a role.”</p>

<p>The role also required Gonzalez to learn combat action for the first time, as her previous action roles in Baby Driver and Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw didn’t require her to really fight.</p>
<p>“I had done other types of action films and it was very different, I’m very physical in this movie. It was really exciting,” Gonzalez says. “It’s something that I’ve always been really passionate about. I love dance, I love martial arts. I love anything that has body expression”
