<em>Spoiler Warning for Devs</em></p>
<p>Well, that was a lot to take in.</p>
<p>If you’re just joining us, you’ve finished the finale of FX on Hulu’s Devs. The heavy episode brought audiences to a pre-determined conclusion, but it arrived at this destination in wholly shocking fashion. The finale answered some of our pressing questions while raising even more in the process and challenged just about every philosophical point Devs has conjured during its eight-episode run. If you’re less than certain about what you just saw, don’t worry, that’s normal. We’re about one more theory away from going full A Beautiful Mind.</p>
<p>Writer and director Alex Garland wants you to think through the series for your own, but that doesn’t mean he’s bereft of his own intentions and points of emphasis. In speaking with Observer ahead of the show’s premiere, Garland provided a bit more context for the finale’s events and what the implications are within the universe of the show.</p>
<p>Observer: In the finale, Stuart ends up killing both Lily and Forest even though Lily broke away from the algorithm by making an unexpected choice. Is this meant to suggest that both free will and determinism exist simultaneously? Lily deviated from her set path and yet her fate was ultimately the same.</p>
<p>Alex Garland: That’s partly, I suppose, saying it’s sort of like the reversions of determinism. What it’s really saying is that our actions may not influence outcomes as much as we think anyway. It’s a sort of humility thing that’s there, I suppose. But it’s also to do with a separate idea within the show that we may be living in many worlds, which is a sort of parallel universe. Many multiple parallel universes. So in any given account that we happen to be seeing one thing, there would be another account where the outcomes were completely different. And in fact, all of those possibilities would be happening at once. So in the end, in a way, what the show is saying is we just happen to be seeing this one, and any other version that you could care to think of would all suddenly unfold.</p>
<p>In the end, that conversation between Lily and Forest at the end of episode 8, where they’re standing in the clearing and Forest says, “Look in this version, this life we’re living is close to paradise and in another one would be closer to hell.” Then there’s a moment where we see him in a sort of dark, sinister place and I think it’s that bit that’s connected to the different versions and outcomes.</p>
<p>That brought me back to when Forest and Katie are talking in bed and they admit that they really like Lily and Jamie, yet they still allow them to walk into their own deaths. Is that partly because they believe in the multiverse theory and they know there are versions of them that will survive, so one timeline death is actually insignificant in the grand scheme?</p>
<p>So the thing about both determinism and free will is it does end up putting our view of the world in a really weird place that has strange effects on our notions of morality and strange thoughts on what we see as events happening around us. When I speak to those who really, truly, deep in their hearts believe that this is the case, you start to realize that their experience of life is very different. They have a completely different view of what it’s like to exist and so partly the show is just trying to shine a light on all those people through the world. If you were to believe that somebody was to die and there was really nothing you could do about it, which would be the deterministic philosophy, you could imagine getting removed and detached like Katie does. Forest too actively participates instead of watching it unfold, even though he knows he’ll die.</p>
<p>How did you land on determinism as a guiding principle for the show? Was it a personal belief, a convincing scientific argument, a combination of both?</p>
<p>It was a combination of both. The thing that interested me about determinism and the way it relates to free will is that it was an idea that felt counterintuitive to one’s sense of reality. We feel pretty certain that we have free will and we have control over our lives because we make decisions. But when you start to break down those choices, it becomes harder to see and the case for determinism becomes strong and stronger.</p>
<p>You just have to identify spontaneous events that happen. But things happen as a direct result of action. The more one looks for spontaneous choices, the more one realizes how hard they are to find because you might reach a point where you can’t find any at all. Even if you go to areas of quantum mechanics, you might be able to say that an electron is going to settle somewhere when it’s observed and is likely to settle in another quadrant when it’s not observed. Even that doesn’t need you to use free will because you might say if you’re driving down the road and you roll the dice and if you get between a one and a five, you’ll turn left. If you get a six, you’ll turn right. There still isn’t a decision involved in turning left or right, it was just a random process that was out of your control.</p>

Nick Offerman stars in Alex Garland’s enigmatic drama set in a shadowy San Francisco tech startup. Plus: Run, a new comedy from Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Here’s what to watch this evening</p>
<p>Devs</p>
<p>9pm, BBC Two</p>
<p>Alex Garland, the writer-director of eerie sci-fi thrillers Ex Machina and Annihilation, brings a typically ineffable new series to the small screen, starring Nick Offerman. Set in the confines of a shadowy San Francisco tech startup, Amaya, we open as programmer Sergei is offered a position in the company’s secretive development department by founder Forest (Offerman). When Sergei goes missing, his girlfriend Lily sets out to discover what caused his sudden disappearance. Enigmatic and filled with striking visuals. Ammar Kalia</p>
<p>The Repair Shop</p>
<p>8pm, BBC One</p>
<p>More precious objects and even more precious memories restored by Jay Blades and his team. Tonight’s highlights include a mechanical birdcage whose song marks the last link between a daughter and her departed trapeze-artist mother. A lesson in the surprising eccentricity behind apparently ordinary lives. Phil Harrison</p>
<p>Rebuilding Notre Dame: Inside the Great Cathedral Rescue</p>
<p>9pm, BBC Four</p>
<p>After an extended recap of the disastrous fire that toppled Notre Dame’s famous spire on 15 April last year, this film embeds with efforts to restore the gothic masterpiece. While 21st-century tech plays a part, it mostly involves the work of patient craftsmen. Graeme Virtue</p>
<p>Run</p>
<p>9pm, Sky Comedy</p>
<p>Merritt Wever and Domhnall Gleeson star as an ex-couple reunited for a trip across America in this charming new comedy produced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Picking up on a pact they made in college – that if each texted the other “run”, they would leave their existing lives to go off together – we open with their awkward reunion. AK</p>
<p>Mike Judge Presents: Tales from the Tour Bus</p>
<p>9.35pm, Sky Comedy</p>
<p>Mike Judge, the Beavis and Butthead and King of the Hill creator, brings his inimitable animation style to a second season of his rock’n’roll anecdotes show. We open with one of the kings of hedonism, George Clinton, who recalls his LSD trips and creation of cosmic funk. AK</p>
<p>Feel Good</p>
<p>10pm, Channel 4</p>
<p>Mae is feeling insecure about sharing a standup bill with George’s teenage crush (Barry Ward), a 00s heart-throb staging his comedy comeback. Meanwhile, George seems to be having trouble giving up on her heteronormative happily-ever-after. Or is that all just in Mae’s mind? Ellen E Jones</p>
<p>Film choice</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest And the band played on … Ewan McGregor and Tara Fitzgerald in Brassed Off. Photograph: The Ronald Grant Archive</p>
<p>Brassed Off (Mark Herman, 1996), 9pm, Film4</p>
<p>Like The Full Monty, it’s a story of northern folk facing industrial ruin; but while Monty is a feelgood movie, Mark Herman’s tale of social injustice is bitterly angry. The pits are on the verge of closure and a community is fragmenting, while Pete Postlethwaite’s colliery band plays on. Paul Howlett</p>

<h3 id="meet-the-cast-of-devs-including-parks--recreations-nick-offerman">Meet the cast of Devs, including Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Nick Offerman</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/film/2020041588060/devs-bbc-two-nick-offerman-cast/0-422-628/devs-nick-offerman-1-t.jpg" alt="img">
BBC Two&rsquo;s Devs is the latest US-import to hit our screens, and follows Lily Chan, a computer engineer who becomes determined to find out the truth behind the quantum computing company Amaya, which is owned by Forest, believing that it is responsible for the mysterious disappearance of her boyfriend. Starring plenty of famous faces, including Parks and Recreation star Nick Offerman, we think this one is going to be a surprise hit. Meet the full cast here&hellip;</p>
<p>Nick Offerman - Forest</p>
<p>Nick is perhaps best known for playing the fan favourite character Ron Swanson in Parks and Recreation. The cantankerous government official with two terrifying ex-wives and a penchant for steaks was a huge hit with fans, and make Nick a household name.

<p>READ: Tamsin Greig forced to seek doctor&rsquo;s help during filming for Belgravia</p>
<p>She recently shared a snap of her Devs castmates on Instagram, writing: &ldquo;I was everyone’s embarrassing mum trying to capture moments that felt important. And so many moments in the making of this series felt important. I know in the context of a global pandemic that feels less true, but at the same time I’ve just never been prouder to be a part of something. Pure, unadulterated joy at going to work and being in these scenes discussing life and love, morality, physics and the nature of the universe. Man, I feel lucky.&rdquo;
