<p>A British holidaymaker who flew to Morocco for a four-day break in mid-March says he is stranded there due to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Tom Ramm said his scheduled flight home on 19 March, and three others he rebooked since, were all cancelled.</p>
<p>He said there had been little communication from the Foreign Office or Easyjet, who he flew out with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on. I came out on a shoestring budget and the money is running out,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old from Mickleton, Gloucestershire, left the UK on 15 March with a friend for &ldquo;a short break, just to get some sunshine&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;We were meant to be flying back on the 19 March with Easyjet. We tried speaking to customer services, but were on the phone for two-and-a-half hours only to get down to 700th in the queue and be cut off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image copyright Tom Ramm Image caption Mr Ramm says he has no idea when he would get home</p>
<p>The tree surgeon said they were paying a reduced rate for an Airbnb in Marrakesh and were grateful to the owners but they would be left with a hefty bill when they leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are lucky the family here are allowing us to stay and we are getting three meals a day. But there is a strict lockdown and one of the ladies here said if you break it then you could be looking at a year in prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added his family were &ldquo;worried sick&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are trying to keep morale high but mental health is a factor and we&rsquo;ve had a few teary phone calls with family back home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image copyright Tom Ramm Image caption He is currently staying in an Airbnb property in Marrakesh</p>
<p>Mr Ramm said the Foreign Office had offered &ldquo;little to no&rdquo; support. A spokesman said consular staff were aware of his situation and providing support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The government has partnered with a number of airlines who have committed to work together to get Brits back to the UK and up to £75m has been made available for charter flights were commercial options are no longer available,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Easyjet said it had operated more than 650 rescue flights so far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are sorry that [Mr Ramm] did not book on to any of these flights as they included services from Morocco to the UK over the last week. Unfortunately he was not contacted because he had transferred on to new flights.&rdquo;

<h3 id="ramm-pharma-corp-receives-federal-approval-and-registration-of-xalex-10-cannabidiol-oral-solution">RAMM Pharma Corp. Receives Federal Approval and Registration of XALEX™ 10 (cannabidiol) Oral Solution</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.globenewswire.com/Attachment/LogoDisplay/834228?filename=834228.jpg&amp;size=1" alt="img">
TORONTO, March 26, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) &ndash; RAMM Pharma Corp. (including its wholly owned subsidiaries, the “Company” or &ldquo;RAMM&rdquo;) (CSE: RAMM), a leader in plant-derived cannabinoid pharmaceutical products, is pleased to announce that the Uruguayan Ministry of Public Health, (Ministerio de Salúd Publica or “MSP”) has approved and registered XALEX™ 10 (cannabidiol) oral solution, a prescription pharmaceutical formulation of highly-purified, plant-derived cannabidiol (CBD) free of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. RAMM has also been granted a license expansion and approval by the Instituto de Regulación y Control de Cannabis (“IRCCA”) for additional proprietary cannabis-based products and to include certain products for veterinary use, further expanding the Company’s robust portfolio of product offerings to the Latin American market.</p>
<p>“The approval of XALEX™ 10 is a significant accomplishment for RAMM Pharma, offering patients another federally approved pharmaceutical CBD medicine,” stated Jack Burnett, Chief Executive Officer.</p>
<p>XALEX™ 10</p>
<p>XALEX™ 10 is a 10% plant-derived pharmaceutical formulation of pure CBD approved by the MSP as an anti-epileptic medication for the treatment of seizures associated with refractory epilepsy. The formulation was developed by RAMM following the success of the Company’s Epifractán™ 2% CBD pharmaceutical product (registered December 2017) and Epifractán™ 5% CBD pharmaceutical product (registered June 2018). Epifractán™ 2% and 5% are currently sold in Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina, Peru and Paraguay and are full spectrum products, which differs from XALEX™ 10 which is a pure CBD isolate free of THC. The rigorous MSP approval process includes stability testing standards which conform to international pharmaceutical requirements for registered pharmaceutical products. These same standards will eventually be required by other countries in Latin America including Brazil and Argentina. XALEX™ 10 is expected to be available in Latin America in the coming months. RAMM&rsquo;s formulation and manufacturing is conducted at its state-of-the-art GMP certified facility.</p>
<p>Additional Treatments Under Investigation</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical cannabinoid medicine has progressively gained approval in a growing number of jurisdictions globally also including the United States and the European Union. CBD is being investigated for other pathologies including chronic pain, anxiety, depression, seizures associated with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) and others.</p>
