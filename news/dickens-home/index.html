<p>It is hard to imagine anyone less suited to living with any kind of restraint than Charles Dickens. Especially, I think, the hyperactive Dickens of 1857, the year he turned 45. By the last days of the summer, he had already written, staged and starred in his own play in London and Manchester; bought, renovated and moved into the house of his childhood dreams in Gad’s Hill, in the village of Higham, Kent; and taken trips to Brighton and Southampton, where he waved his 16-year-old son on to a troopship bound for India.</p>
<p>In the May he had finished his latest novel, Little Dorritt, and in June had given his first-ever public readings (a crowd of 2,000 turned up to hear him declaim and weep his way through A Christmas Carol). Editing his monthly magazine was also keeping him busy, as was his charity for homeless women. Dozens of letters flowed.</p>

<p>And still he burned and suffocated and paced the London streets, often through the night. On 29 August, he wrote to his friend Wilkie Collins, begging him to come away, it didn’t matter where. I want to “escape from myself”, he scrawled – as if that were ever possible. Collins suggested Norfolk, but Dickens (all of a sudden no longer relaxed about their destination) insisted on going to the Lake District. He wanted “moors and bleak places”, he wrote, but in truth what he wanted was to get to Doncaster, where 18-year-old actress Ellen Ternan was appearing with her mother and sisters at the Theatre Royal.</p>
<p>Dickens and Collins got lost in fog on Carrock Fell, and Collins sprained his ankle, badly, but Dickens dragged him to Doncaster, and stuffed him into a hotel room to recover while he entertained Ellen and her mother at the races. He won large, jumping up and down at the “coming-in” – the last turn behind the brow of the hill – and marvelled at the scale of the grandstand, “rising against the sky with its vast tiers of little white dots of faces, and its last high rows and corners of people, looking like pins stuck into an enormous pin-cushion”.</p>
<p>The image of a packed racetrack seething with spectators has a different resonance today. Our lockdown started late and is ending – or not – in confusion. I doubt Dickens would have coped well with this uncertainty, but who does? We are trapped in the back of a car on a long, dark journey, and the world’s worst parents keep telling us every few miles that we are nearly there. Surely they know that those words, at this stage, are a trigger for rage and despair?</p>

<p>The Dickens of 1857 would have had trouble enduring lockdown. He went home after his trip to Doncaster and set about tearing apart his own life, closing his magazine, selling his London home and divorcing his wife Catherine with shocking vindictiveness. But we can still lose ourselves in his adventures in the Lake District (he wrote that Skiddaw in particular had “vaunted himself a great deal more than his merits deserve”) and the roiling excitement of a day at the races. It’s all there (including his thinly disguised pursuit of Ellen Ternan) in the book he wrote with Collins, The Lazy Tour of Two Idle Apprentices.</p>
<p>Even on that seemingly carefree jaunt to the Lakes and then Doncaster, Dickens was starting to look older than his years; he died 13 years later, on 9 June 1870, aged 58, struck dumb and then dead by a stroke (not his first). He had never stopped writing, of course, but nor had he ever been able to stay still for long. He crisscrossed the country, giving talks and readings, feasting on the rapturous crowds. He toured America. He wrote some of his greatest books even as the darkness spread. His last novel, The Mystery of Edwin Drood, was left half-finished on his desk in the garden chalet at Gad’s Hill.</p>
<p>And on the morning before he finally collapsed, Dickens dropped into the Sir John Falstaff pub in Higham (still there, opposite his former home) and cashed a cheque with the landlord for £22. Most of the money might have been for Ellen Ternan, who by then was living in Peckham, south-east London. Because as far as Dickens was concerned, on that sunny June morning 150 years ago, life was going on just as it always had.</p>

<h3 id="charles-dickens-150-years-on-debate-still-rages-over-his-misogynist-label">&ldquo;Charles Dickens: 150 years on, debate still rages over his ‘misogynist’ label&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/339743/original/file-20200604-67372-1o3eq7o.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;rect=3%2C520%2C2400%2C1199&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1356&amp;h=668&amp;fit=crop" alt="img">
“Charles Dickens the misogynist”, ran a headline in the Mail on Sunday on May 23 2020, publicising a new book marking the 150th anniversary of his death on June 9 1870. “The novelist was cruel to his wife, hated his mother [and] had an affair”, it reported.</p>
<p>But this is an old story. When news broke last year that a cache of letters at Harvard University had disclosed Dickens’s attempt to place his wife, Catherine, in an asylum, it only confirmed for many that he was a stereotypically “ruthless Victorian husband”. Dickens’s affair with Ellen Ternan and cruel treatment of his wife are well known and he has long been criticised for depicting weak females in his fiction. But was what the Mail called “his need to control and manipulate members of the opposite sex” really “a defining feature of his life”?</p>
<p>To a large extent, Dickens’s beliefs about women were typical of the age. “God created men and women different – then let them remain each in their own position”, declared Queen Victoria in the year of Dickens’s death – and in many respects, Dickens shared this view. Women’s supposed innate purity and selflessness were held to fit her for the making of a home that would serve as a refuge for the man who must endure the rigours of public life.</p>
<p>Mrs Jellyby in Bleak House is probably Dickens’s best-known example of a woman betraying the home in this way, neglecting her own children in favour of raising funds for the distant natives of Borrioboola-Gha. She devotes herself to this cause and, as a result, her house is dirty, the servants unruly, and her unfortunate husband neglected. Notably, Mrs Jellyby is last heard of in the novel perversely continuing to neglect her home duties by campaigning for “the rights of women to sit in parliament”.</p>
<p>Dickens also set out to satirise such agitating women in Household Words, the journal he published throughout the 1850s. A polemical piece he published on Rights and Wrongs of Women lampooned those women who aspired to become an “inferior man”, and extolled instead the path of “a noble, unpretending, redeeming, domestic, usefulness” to be taken by “the loving, quiet wife, the good mother, the sweet unselfish sister”. “Give woman public functions”, the anonymous contributor wrote, “and you destroy the very springs of her influence”.</p>
<p>Illustration by &lsquo;Phiz&rsquo; (Hablot K. Browne) via <a href="http://www.victorianweb.org/">http://www.victorianweb.org/</a></p>
<p>But Dickens also explored the constrictions of women’s roles in his fiction through disruptive female figures who help to expose the limitations of the Victorian feminine domestic ideal: like Rosa Dartle, Bella Wilfer or Edith Dombey, whose rage at her powerlessness, “There is no slave in a market, there is no horse in a fair, so shown and offered and paraded … as I have been”, continues to resonate.</p>
<p>As in his fiction, so in his journalism, Dickens’s response to demands for reform of the position of women was more complex than is often appreciated. He was prepared to support campaigns against particular legal and social injustices suffered by women and he was not unsympathetic towards the demand for extending employment opportunities for them.</p>
<p>Promoting women</p>
<p>Indeed, he was especially supportive of women’s efforts to reach out to a wider public sphere within his own field of expertise – literature and journalism. For the author of the Household Words essay, the Rights and Wrongs of Women, was a woman – and the first English female newspaper correspondent to draw a fixed salary: Eliza Lynn (Linton).</p>
<p>Dickens encouraged women writers to contribute to his journals, recruiting prominent authors such as Harriet Martineau, Elizabeth Gaskell and Eliza Lynn when he founded Household Words in 1850. Lynn had worked for two years on the staff of the Morning Chronicle and published three novels before she became a Household Words contributor in 1853. She wrote for the journal up until the last year of its publication, contributing more than 60 items. Dickens came to value her work highly: “Good for anything and thoroughly reliable”, he wrote against her name when making out a list of contributors at one time.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lynn Linton; Her Life, Letters, and Opinions by George Somes Layard</p>
<p>Ironically, while Lynn shared Dickens’s conviction that women’s aspirations to participate in public life undermined their proper, natural duties within the home, she defied the stereotype herself. As a hard-working journalist within the male domain of the Victorian newspaper and periodical press, her career challenged the accepted idea of womanhood and questioned the limits placed upon the female role.</p>
<p>Lynn first met Dickens at a dinner party and later recalled his kindness to her: “He included me, then quite a beginner in literature, young in years and shy by temperament, and made me feel at home with him”, she writes. When her father died in 1855, she sold Gad’s Hill Place, where part of her early youth had been spent, to Dickens, and visiting some years after his death, remembered:</p>
<p>How bright he was! How keen and observant! His eyes seemed to penetrate through yours into your very brain, and he was one of the men to whom, had I been given that way, I could not have dared to tell a lie. He would have seen the truth written in plain characters behind the eyes, and traced in the lines about the mouth.</p>
<p>Such a profound capacity for truth-seeing and telling is of course just one of the qualities for which we remember Dickens on the anniversary of his death. While his reputation as an exponent of the “home goddess” stereotype is undeniable, he also imagined strong women, rebellious women, and women inwardly divided, who provide a more complex picture of his fictional treatment of the opposite sex than this reputation suggests.</p>
<p>And in the practical support he gave to women like Eliza Lynn, we remember above all his deep commitment to writing, to the professions of literature and journalism, and his unshakeable belief in their ability to move us so as to remedy social injustice and inequality for women and men.

<h3 id="the-mystery-of-charles-dickens-by-an-wilson-review--a-great-writers-dark-side">&ldquo;The Mystery of Charles Dickens by AN Wilson review – a great writer&rsquo;s dark side&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd7274f3fe47ed341212a4001a606b0b74caa465/673_0_3315_1989/master/3315.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=ecfdda562606bfc6eccb927e4b563b5a" alt="img">
Near the end of The Mystery of Charles Dickens, AN Wilson quotes at length from a letter written by Philip Larkin to his lover Monica Jones. The poet has just reread Great Expectations, and is reflecting on the novelist’s attention-seeking tricks: “Say what you like about Dickens as an entertainer, he cannot be considered a real writer at all; not a real novelist.” It is a version of a complaint that has been made many times about Dickens the mere “entertainer”. “His is the garish, gaslit, melodramatic barn … where the yokels gape.” Yet, at the end of all his sentences of critical deprecation, Larkin’s final reflex is equally familiar: “However, I much enjoyed G.E. &amp; may try another soon.”</p>
<p>Those with high literary standards have often enjoyed Dickens against their better judgment. In The Mystery of Charles Dickens, Wilson sides with the gaping yokels. He confesses the he has read Dickens with “obsessive rapture” since his childhood, but had to overcome the presumption, later educated into him, that his writing was insufficiently deep or sophisticated. “The death of Paul Dombey is so schmaltzy that we simply refuse to be moved, but then, damn it, we read and the tears well down our cheeks.” For Wilson, Dickens is an irresistible performer. One chapter of his book is devoted to “The Mystery of the Public Readings”, in which Dickens drove himself to near collapse (and made huge amounts of money) by touring America as well as Britain to perform readings from his work. In 1869, he had a stroke on stage in Chester, but still refused to stop the readings, partly because of the money but mostly because he was addicted to the instant responsiveness of his audience.</p>

<p>The highlight of his show was Bill Sikes’s murder of Nancy from Oliver Twist, in which, Wilson thinks, the novelist released some demonic aspect of himself – some yen for sexual violence – on stage. Murderous villains such as the gleefully sadistic Quilp in The Old Curiosity Shop, or the psychopathic John Jasper in The Mystery of Edwin Drood, were projections of his own cruelty. Wilson’s book is, you might say, bio-critical: “Dickens’s novels tell the story over and over again of his divided self,” he writes. The secrets of his life lie on the surface of his fiction. The dust jacket proclaims that the book goes “beyond standard narrative biography”. Which is to say that The Mystery of Charles Dickens does not reveal anything the previous biographers have not told us (indeed, it is conscientiously reliant on a small number of secondary sources). Instead, it shows, by a mixture of rational inference and I-feel-it-in-my-bones intuition, how the most powerful aspects of Dickens’s fiction drew on the most painful and secret aspects of his life.</p>
<p>The biggest secret of Dickens’s life, of course, was his clandestine relationship with Ellen (“Nelly”) Ternan, the young actor whom he first met when she performed at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester in The Frozen Deep, a play that he had written with his friend Wilkie Collins, and in which he himself was acting. She was 18; he was 45. For the next 13 years, Dickens paid for her to live in a series of discreetly located residences, where he would secretly visit her. The last of these was Windsor Lodge in Peckham, then a pleasant village outside London, with a railway station on the line from Dickens’s Kent home.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;seizure&rsquo; that killed Dickens must have been induced by energetic sex, the dying novelist was then driven to his Kent home</p>
<p>Each chapter of Wilson’s book is a different “Mystery”, the first being what happened to most of the £22 for which Dickens cashed a cheque on the day before his death. Dickens must have given it to Nelly for housekeeping. Which means that he must have made a quick trip to Peckham and that the “seizure” that killed him must have been induced by some hyper-energetic sex with her. Which means that hasty measures must have been taken to heave the dying novelist into a carriage to be driven back to his Kent home. “Exit Nelly, stage left.” (This enjoyable fiction, which has been hazarded by others before Wilson, is partly withdrawn near the end of the book.)</p>
<p>Next is “The Mystery of his Childhood”. Wilson is hardly the first to suggest that Dickens’s fiction was shaped by what he calls “the grotesquely sad galanty show of his childhood”. He briskly takes us through the story of the penury, the period in the debtors’ prison, the aborted education, the banishment, aged 10, to menial labour in Warren’s Blacking warehouse. There is less stress than usual on the improvidence of Dickens’s father, John Dickens (whose self-relishing orotundity at least inspired the matchless idiolect of Mr Micawber). Instead, Dickens blamed his mother. The ludicrous (Mrs Nickleby) or monstrous (Mrs Clennam) mothers in his novels bear the imprint of “the deepest needs of mother-hate”. Wilson asserts that “his flawed relationship with his mother is the defining feature, of the man and of his art”. Yet his privations made him a great novelist. The Blacking warehouse “saved Dickens the novelist, just as grammar school and Cambridge would have destroyed him”.</p>
<p>We should be grateful Dickens was so screwed up. Great Expectations, Wilson believes, was a masterpiece of self-torment</p>
<p>Then there is “The Mystery of the Cruel Marriage”. Nothing has more tainted Dickens’s reputation than his public repudiation (via an advertisement in the Times) of his wife, Kate, who had borne him 10 children and suffered all his demands for 22 years. Wilson’s house, he tells us, overlooks the back garden of 70 Gloucester Crescent, Camden Town, whence Catherine Dickens was exiled, with the company of only one of her children, Charley, their eldest son. The others were forbidden to see her. We have found out recently that Dickens tried to have her certified insane, so that she would be put in an asylum. Not only did he want to be free to pursue an affair with Nelly Ternan, he wanted somehow to declare that it was all his blameless wife’s fault. He was the wounded party.</p>
<p>But all the fury and resentment that he felt towards first his mother, and then his wife, inspired his greatest fiction, Wilson thinks. We should be grateful that he was so screwed up. Great Expectations, he believes, was a masterpiece of self-torment, formed from his own ruthlessness, his hunger for money and status, his family hatreds – all handed down to the novel’s narrator, Pip. “A helpful course of cognitive therapy, such as our contemporaries would have urged on a middle-aged man who had just visited such absolute mayhem on his wife and children” would have destroyed his creativity. Just as Pip owed his fortune to a violent criminal, Magwitch, its author owed his lucrative brilliance to “a secret, violent criminal”: himself. Or rather, the dark and nasty secret self that he never consciously acknowledged.</p>
<p>Wilson concedes all the contradictions and hypocrisies anatomised by John Carey in his brilliant, often openly exasperated study of Dickens, The Violent Effigy – but forgives him. Dickens had to contend with the “vast, smoky, cruel, boundlessly energetic, steel-hearted nineteenth century”, which made him variously cruel and sentimental. He was, after all, a nobody, who had grown up “with nuffink”. Alone among all great writers of the 19th century, he had “not merely looked over into the abyss. He had lived in it.” His lifelong insecurity was another creative asset.</p>
<p>If you are a Dickens aficionado, you will think that much of the book’s biographical narrative is well-known material, though here revisited in a sprightly manner. Yet its last, highly personal section suddenly shifts your sense of Wilson’s commitment to his subject. In his final chapter, he remembers first encountering episodes from Dickens at the age of eight or nine at his private school, which was “in effect a concentration camp run by sexual perverts”. The teacher who introduced him to Dickens was himself utterly sinister and Dickensian, the skill with which he impersonated Fagin and Squeers “all too convincing”. The shards of Dickens sustained his spirits among the privations and abuse visited on him by the paedophile headmaster and his monstrous wife, uninhibited sadists in Wilson’s vivid, detailed account. After this, nothing would convince him that Dickens should be condescended to as insufficiently “realistic”. And in returning him to the “abject terror and hopelessness” of childhood, but with that strange Dickensian stir of laughter (Fagin and Squeers, those comic turns), the novelist, hypocritical and self-deceiving as he might have been, has done him some matchless kindness.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.kentonline.co.uk/_media/img/ZLBMDHD4VJPRECTFNLZU.jpg" alt="img">
He brought us colourful characters, long-lived lessons in morality and social class - and above all, human stories.</p>
<p>Author Charles Dickens died 150 years ago today, and we take a look at his links to Kent and how the county inspired many of his stories.</p>
<p>Charles Dickens spent much of his life in Kent</p>
<p>Charles Dickens wrote at least 23 novels, with quotes that live on today, and many of which have references to Kent in them, including sights and people from Sheerness, Medway and Thanet.</p>
<p>Born on February 7, 1812, in Portsmouth, the second of eight children, Charles and his family moved to Sheerness when he was a child.</p>
<p>The family is reported to have rented a house in Blue Town next to what was called the Sheerness Theatre, where the young Charles forged a firm friendship with the theatre owner’s son Douglas William Jerrold, who later became one of the first editors of Punch magazine.</p>
<p>It is believed Dickens based convict Magwitch in Great Expectations (1861) on the real-life case of London crook Judah Solomon who was sent to a prison hulk at Sheerness but escaped onto the marshes.</p>
<p>The opening scene of Great Expectations, where Pip meets the convict, the &ldquo;marsh country&rdquo; is the marshes around Higham. And in The Old Curiosity Shop, Dickens also describes the forerunner of the Bethel church, at Minster, on Sheppey.</p>
<p>This year is the 150th anniversary of Charles Dickens&rsquo; death</p>
<p>Later the family moved to Chatham due to his father John&rsquo;s postings in the Royal Navy, where he was a pay clerk. He worked in the Royal Navy Pay Office at Chatham dockyard, which can still be seen in the historic town today behind the Commissioner&rsquo;s House.</p>
<p>The Dickens&rsquo; family home in Ordnance Terrace can still be seen near Chatham station, which, during Dickens’ childhood, was an area of fields overlooking St Mary’s Church.</p>
<p>The Commissioners House at the dockyard, near to where Dickens&rsquo; father worked</p>
<p>Growing up in the Medway Towns meant many scenic descriptions in his novels were inspired by the area. In The Pickwick Papers, Dickens described a view from Rochester Bridge: “On either side, the banks of the Medway, covered with cornfields and pastures&hellip; rendered more beautiful by the changing shadows which passed swiftly across it, as thin and half-formed clouds skimmed away in the light of the morning sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the gardens of Eastgate House - which became the model for Westgate House in Pickwick Papers - the author&rsquo;s Swiss Chalet can still be seen. A present from his French actor friend Charles Fechter, it arrived at Higham Railway Station on Christmas Eve 1864, packed in 58 boxes. It used to be in Dickens&rsquo; garden in Higham, in a part known as The Wilderness and was where he worked on many of his novels.</p>
<p>The city mansion Restoration House in Crow Lane is said to be Satis House of Great Expectations, the home of Miss Havisham, while the Guildhall - &lsquo;as if Time carried on his business there, and hung out his sign&rsquo; - also appears in Great Expectations. The Gatehouse to the Cathedral and the Cathedral itself both appear in The Mystery of Edwin Drood, Dickens&rsquo; final novel while The Bull Inn in Rochester is described as &ldquo;the good house&rdquo; in Pickwick Papers. He also based &ldquo;Muggleton&rdquo; on Maidstone - The Muggleton Inn in Maidstone High Street takes its name from the book.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a carved stone inscription in Rochester High Street to the home of Joe Specks, though Joe was not a real person - he was a character in Dickens&rsquo; book The Uncommercial Traveller.</p>
<p>In his 40s, after spending much of his adult life in London, Dickens could not resist returning to the place he knew and loved, and bought Georgian country house Gads Hill Place in Higham. He had first spotted the house as a child and was determined to buy it.</p>
<p>Restoration House in Crow Lane</p>
<p>On the other side of the county, Broadstairs, where he frequently holidayed, is home to the Dickens House Museum, once home to Miss Mary Pearson Strong who inspired the character of Betsey Trotwood and the Grade II-listed mansion Bleak House, the most prominent building in the town. Formerly known as Fort House, the building was his favourite holiday home where he planned and wrote parts of David Copperfield, Bleak House and Our English Watering Place.</p>
<p>Dickens lived at Gads Hill Place</p>
<p>You can take your own Dickens trail around many of his local haunts.</p>
<p>Begin by exploring the area around Gravesend, as Chalk was where he spent his honeymoon; there is a dedicated 6.6-mile Dickens route around Higham village, skirting the marshland from the opening of Great Expectations. From there, you can head to Gad&rsquo;s Hill Place around where Dickens was often spotted taking countryside walks. He bought the property, now a school, in 1856. It was here that he wrote A Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations and The Mystery of Edwin Drood before his death in 1870. At nearby Cobham he found inspiration for the Pickwick Papers in The Leather Bottle, described by many as Dickens’ favourite ale house.</p>
<p>Eastgate House, High Street, Rochester.</p>
<p>Head to Rochester and you&rsquo;ll see many of the buildings on its high street carry plaques detailing how they were incorporated into his novels, and at nearby Chatham you can walk past the dockyard where Dickens’ father worked from 1817.</p>
<p>Take a drive over to Broadstairs, and you can see the traditional Dickens House Museum, and imposing Bleak House, overlooking Viking Bay. The town, like Rochester, has been home to an annual Dickens Festival for many years. Visit Thanet has an interactive map with places of interest to visit and details of the plaques around the town at visitthanet.co.uk</p>
<p>A keen walker, Dickens once said: “If I could not walk far and fast, I think I should just explode and perish.”</p>
<p>Following in his footsteps, Geoff Ettridge, aka Geoff Rambler, led a series of walks to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Dickens&rsquo; birth in 2012, raising funds towards the restoration of the Swiss Chalet.</p>
<p>He had been hoping to do the same this year to mark the 150thanniversary of his death and although this is cancelled as a result of the current crisis, his book about the Rochester Dickens would have known and local people, places and events that inspired him, Rochester - a Monument to Dickens? is available at geofframbler.blog/book</p>
<p>Dickens is celebrated in Rochester city centre each year Picture: Tony Jones</p>
<p>Dickens died on June 9, 150 years ago, and this year would have been filled with festivals, exhibition and other events.In Broadstairs, the organising committee of the festival is considering, in conjunction with Sarah Thorne Theatre, staging a play when restrictions are lifted. Details will be posted at broadstairsdickensfestival.co.uk</p>
<p>Gravesham council has postponed its celebratory events, with hopes they can be done later in the year, while much of Medway&rsquo;s have also had to be put on hold, though some will continue online. Virtual events organised by Medway Council being held from today until Sunday include videos ofDr Jeremy Clarke talking about the private life of Dickens at home in Higham; the best quotes from his book with an explanation by Dr Clarke, chosen by the team at the Guildhall Museum; and children&rsquo;s activities including a drawing activity and treasure hunt supported by objects from the Guildhall Museum collection.</p>
<p>All events will be posted on the Enjoy Medway social media pages. To find out more go to medway.gov.uk/dickens150</p>
<p>The Muggleton Inn in Maidstone takes its named from one of Dickens&rsquo; tales</p>
<p>If reaching for Dickens&rsquo; books isn&rsquo;t on your to-do list, there are some films you can sit down and watch of his enduring tales.</p>
<p>Oliver! (1968)</p>
<p>The all-singing, all-dancing tale of death, poverty and crime has some memorable songs and performances, including Ron Moody as Fagin, Oliver Reed as the glowering Bill Sykes, and of course, Bullseye the dog.</p>
<p>The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992)</p>
<p>A Muppet movie first and foremost, it has catchy songs and sterling work from Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat, plus possibly one of Michael Caine&rsquo;s finest performances, as Scrooge - arguably the most joyous version of any Dickens novel.</p>
<p>The Muppet Christmas Carol</p>
<p>Great Expectations (1946)</p>
<p>Wrestling the enormity of Great Expectations into a manageable film is feat enough, but from Magwitch&rsquo;s cemetery introduction to Martita Hunt&rsquo;s ghostly Miss Havisham, to the end, Lean&rsquo;s film is considered definitive. New versions of Great Expectations are still judged against this.</p>
<p>The Personal History Of David Copperfield (2019)</p>
<p>Writer-director Armando Iannucci realises great expectations with his madcap take on Charles Dickens’s literary hero. The film breathlessly abridges the mid-19th century serial and novel to focus on the quixotic characters. It will be available on Amazon Prime from next week.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.19053616408780136%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_52/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/be7e9ad50571107ed401f73b94e2a0493bc78f88" alt="img">
“In the course of those nights, I finished my education in a fair amateur experience of houselessness,” Dickens wrote. He came across the sick, the wraithlike in rags beneath a dripping sky, the alcohol-addicted “magnetically attracted to each other”, the diseased, the mercifully unconscious on Waterloo Bridge, the Thames below with “an awful look” holding reflected light “as if the spectres of suicides were holding them to show where they went down”.

Credit:Getty Images He mused on the nightmares of the insane locked away in Bethlehem Hospital and thought of the damned in the debtors’ prison, where his own father had been incarcerated. Before dawn, he found children scavenging for offal among market stalls at Covent Garden. Should you be searching for a short masterpiece to see you through the long night of the pandemic, Night Walks might be appropriate, if nightmarish.</p>
<p>It fulfils the need of the insomniac to escape to another place and time, and to do so with a guide who understands personally the affliction of sleep denied. And should you find yourself not brave or inquisitive enough to venture on your own night walk, it might serve to remind that more than a century-and-a-half later, in the streets of every Australian city, there are increasing numbers of those whom Dickens called “houseless”. Homeless woman Rachel, 37, appeals for work on Elizabeth Street in May 2019. Credit:Simon Schluter Indeed, no one needs to drift through the night streets of Melbourne or Sydney or even a regional town to know that this wealthy nation of ours has allowed the hope of a roof and a safe bed to slip through the hands of an unconscionable number of its citizens. The lost are stretched out in broad daylight in numerous doorways and on the footpaths of busy city streets — unimaginable less than a generation ago.</p>
<p>Vastly more of modern Australia’s “houseless” are hidden: squeezing into severely overcrowded dwellings, couch surfing, existing in fetid rooming houses or living in supported or temporary emergency arrangements. According to the last census in 2016, 116,400 Australians were homeless. That amounted to one in every 200 Australians. And while the national population had grown by 8.8 per cent in the five years between 2011 and 2016, homelessness had increased by 14 per cent. Agencies dealing with homelessness know these figures have simply increased in the years since the census. To most of us, statistics go in one ear and out the other. But we have no earthly right to ignore that at least 20,000 Australian children are without a home: the Australian Bureau of Statistics found that 19,400 children aged up to 14 were homeless on census night in 2016.</p>
<p>SBS television is currently screening its latest series of Filthy Rich and Homeless, in which privileged Australians are placed on the streets and in crisis accommodation to experience first-hand the soul-sapping days and nights of those who have no home and often no safety. Loading The wealthy participants invariably find themselves weeping — and so, perhaps, ought the audience — at the sudden knowledge they had lived their lives entirely ignorant of the dreadful reality faced every day by those they had previously passed by, eyes averted. They are, in effect, seeing precisely what Dickens had described 160 years ago: “My principal object being to get through the night, the pursuit of it brought me into sympathetic relations with people who have no other object every night of the year.” The participants in the SBS series are let into the truth that those condemned to homelessness do not simply have no house to call their own. They have no home: a much deeper conceptual tragedy.

<p>A tale of two cities in one</p>
<p>Timothy Nash Timothy Nash Image 1 of / 3 Caption Close A tale of two cities in one 1 / 3 Back to Gallery</p>
<p>Recent events prompted us to draw parallels to the opening line of Charles Dickens’ fictional classic, A Tale of Two Cities, set during the turbulent French Revolution. Most remember that it opens with: “It was the best of times. It was the worst of times.” Unlike Dickens’ work, however, our story is true.</p>
<p>Our “best of times” provides the good fortune that we work at Northwood University’s main campus in Midland and live in the vibrant Great Lakes Bay region.</p>
<p>Our “worst of times” can be summarized by the fact that Midland and Northwood, like most places, are adversely impacted by the economic and political constraints used to fight the coronavirus pandemic, resulting in a -5 percent GDP in the first quarter and a likely -30+ percent GDP in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Intensifying our plight, Northwood and Midland were, as Michigan, America and the world watched, ravaged recently by heavy rainfall and historic flooding due to the failure of two nearby dams. This travesty resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in estimated damage caused by devastating negligence.</p>
<p>More than a week before the flood, Midlanders were hoping for the best and preparing for the worst. The community response that followed symbolizes the indomitable spirit of what it means to be a Midlander and what we at Northwood believe it means to be free. That, in times of crisis, it is the individual and private groups who most often respond far more quickly and effectively than government can react.</p>
<p>Midland’s many volunteer and philanthropic organizations, along with faith-based groups far and near, activated quickly and adroitly to tirelessly serve the community with labor, hope, comfort and relief. This can-do effort is reflective of a special DNA woven throughout the social fabric of America to do the right thing and help those in need.</p>
<p>Literally, as the flood waters were still receding, Midlanders, supported by Northwood’s faculty, staff and students immediately began to volunteer their time, talent and treasure. Without direction from central government, over the ensuing days, these caring citizens, began to clean up flooded basements, rip out contaminated dry wall and flooring, remove trash to expedite the city’s recovery, and started to donate their financial resources to assist those most impacted by the floodwaters. Upon reflection, it is a beautiful experience to see citizens act swiftly and freely because they simply feel responsible for themselves and their neighbors.</p>
<p>There are many examples of neighborly-kindness, and a shining example of our collective humanity is the community’s response to the plight of a colleague, Professor Glenn Moots. The damage to the Moots&rsquo; family home, located near one of the failed dams, required it to be completely gutted. A GoFundMe page has raised a substantial amount to cover lost wages, living expenses and help in the rebuild. Literally hundreds of volunteers have performed tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of clean-up and pre-construction work on the family home, while never asking for a dime. Long before a government entity even knew of his plight, friends and inspired strangers were there in his greatest hour of need. Making a tragedy more palatable, these volunteers, especially the Moots family ‘s larger church body, the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, gives them hope for a home restored by Christmas.</p>
<p>As a university, we continue to respond decisively with helplines and action plans to mitigate the flood damage to our campus, located along the scenic banks of the Tittabawassee River. Our flood relief plan will allow us to make the campus better and more resilient than ever when we open this fall.</p>
<p>While insurance companies are issuing reports, often denying claims and state and federal agencies assess their roles, Midland ultimately is coming back faster than most thought possible because of volunteerism and massive doses of individual kindness and charity.</p>
<p>There is an important role for government, yet Midlanders, our mid-Michigan neighbors and “Timberwolves” (Northwood faculty, staff, students, alumni and friends) can take great pride in our fast and compassionate response can usher in a “best of times.” Together, we are proving once again that “the worst of times” brings out our very best and that free people can and do accomplish great things.</p>

Armando Iannucci’s distinctive take on David Copperfield, streaming from Monday, is just the latest chapter in TV and cinema’s endless appetite for Pip, Oliver, Miss Havisham and co</p>
<p>There was a BBC documentary some years ago titled Dickens on Film that posited Charles Dickens as a kind of spiritual father of modern cinema. Television might be even closer to the mark, but there’s something to it either way: the DNA of Dickens’s busy, episodic storytelling, delivered in instalments and rife with cliffhangers and diversions, is traceable in everything from Coronation Street to the films of Paul Thomas Anderson.</p>
<p>No surprise, then, that more than 400 big- and small-screen adaptations have been made from his novels, with Armando Iannucci’s recent, rumbustious The Personal History of David Copperfield the latest. Out on DVD and streaming platforms from Monday, it enjoyably retains all the ornate period finery and star-speckled romping of past versions, but modernises things with imaginative multiracial casting and an added twist of Iannucci’s signature salty vernacular to the original text. It’s all a bit compressed: Copperfield’s winding saga doesn’t fit neatly in under two hours, so it’s constantly in motion but less moving than it could be. Still, it has a frisky, Dickensian spirit: for many younger viewers, it may come to seem definitive.</p>

<p>As oft-filmed as Dickens’s novels have been, they’ve yielded fewer cast-iron classics than you might think. David Lean pretty much reached the summit of this subgenre in 1946 with his superb version of Great Expectations (free to stream for BritBox subscribers, and also available on iTunes). It may have significantly abridged the novel, but found such rich cinematic language for Pip’s long journey in the looming gothic shadows and enveloping mists of Guy Green’s Oscar-winning black-and-white cinematography that it still feels nourishingly complete. Nobody has pulled off the balance quite so stylishly since – not even Lean himself, though he came close enough two years later with his satisfyingly atmospheric take on Oliver Twist (available on the BFI Player).</p>
<p>Lean effectively nailing those two novels hasn’t stopped them from being remade on a regular basis, with varying degrees of success. His Oliver Twist holds up better than Roman Polanski’s surprisingly standard-issue and largely forgotten version from 2005 (on iTunes), though for many, Carol Reed’s bright, Oscar-laden 1968 musical rendition of Oliver! (on Amazon) has been their childhood gateway to Dickens. Who can resist those tunes and swirling choreography? Unlike most critics, I retain much affection for Alfonso Cuarón’s 1998 Generation X update of Great Expectations (on Chili), which converts the icy anti-romance between Pip and Estella into a kind of woozy, indie-scored time capsule of how love was supposed to look in the 90s – ravishingly photographed by Emmanuel Lubezki, of course.</p>

<p>Back in 1935, MGM lavished money on an all-star version of David Copperfield from super-producer David O Selznick and director George Cukor. Both fun and a little creaky, it’s streaming on Chili, and the curious should check it out for very American comedian WC Fields’s stab at Mr Micawber alone. Selznick was pleased enough with it to immediately have a go at A Tale of Two Cities (on Amazon), and it makes something rousing and swooningly romantic out of Dickens’s soapiest novel. It’s hardly the season, but A Christmas Carol has probably been his most generously-served work on screen: if you’re in the mood for some summer Yuletide spirit, 1951’s Scrooge (Google Play) still honours it best.</p>
<p>Yet while certain Dickens novels get endlessly recycled, film-makers still seem daunted by others. The rarity of the attempt makes the absence of Christine Edzard’s muscular six-hour film of Little Dorrit (1987) from any streaming services all the more disappointing. Douglas McGrath’s 2002 take on Nicholas Nickleby, happily, can be found on Amazon: it’s attractively mounted and cast, and so easily accessible you wonder why it hasn’t been done to death in cinemas.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the roomy dimensions of the TV miniseries have been kinder to many Dickens novels. No surprise that a number of them are available in digital boxset form on BritBox, including the BBC’s absorbing, Claire Foy-led Little Dorrit (2008) and its vast, all-star Bleak House (2005), both deftly adapted by Andrew Davies. Britbox also has the 1999 and 2011 miniseries versions of Great Expectations, for any completists who want to be fully caught up as the BBC readies yet another TV adaptation for production. And you can head over to Amazon for the Beeb’s 1990s renditions of Martin Chuzzlewit and Our Mutual Friend. You’ll have viewing lined up for days: if Dickens is the spiritual father of anything, perhaps it’s the modern binge-watch.</p>
