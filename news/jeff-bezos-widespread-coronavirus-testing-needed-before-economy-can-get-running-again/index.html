Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said Thursday that mass testing around the world for the coronavirus is needed to &ldquo;get the economy back up and running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his annual shareholder letter, Bezos also pointed to efforts Amazon has taken to protect its employees from the pandemic.</p>
<p>Bezos pointed to Amazon&rsquo;s efforts to develop &ldquo;incremental testing capacity,&rdquo; which the company announced last week. As part of that announcement, Amazon said it hopes to begin testing all of its employees, including those who show no symptoms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running,&rdquo; Bezos said. &ldquo;For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than is currently available.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bezos detailed other steps Amazon has taken to curb the coronavirus, such as providing employees with face masks and distributing temperature checks for warehouse workers, delivery drivers and Whole Foods employees. He added that Amazon temporarily closed some of its physical stores, including Amazon Books, Amazon 4-star and Amazon Pop Up stores as they don&rsquo;t sell essential products, and offered those store employees roles in other parts of the company.</p>
<p>Despite the new safety measures, Amazon workers from at least three facilities have staged protests to call for the company to close facilities where there are positive cases of the virus. A dozen workers told CNBC they felt Amazon needed to provide employees with paid time off, among other concerns.</p>
<p>Amazon&rsquo;s logistics and delivery systems have been under some strain since the pandemic worsened across the globe. Due to a surge in online orders, the company was forced to prioritize shipments of essential goods at its fulfillment centers, resulting in longer delivery times and a rare disruption to its typical two-day and one-day delivery windows.</p>
<p>Bezos said unlike the typical holiday shopping season, the surge over the last few months &ldquo;occurred with little warning, creating major challenges for our suppliers and delivery network.&rdquo; For that reason and others, Bezos added that his &ldquo;own time and thinking&rdquo; continues to be focused on the coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am extremely grateful to my fellow Amazonians for all the grit and ingenuity they are showing as we move through this,&rdquo; Bezos said. &ldquo;You can count on all of us to look beyond the immediate crisis for insights and lessons and how to apply them going forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amazon had 798,000 full-time and part-time employees as of Dec. 31 and has hired more than 100,000 new employees since March to deal with coronavirus demands and plans to add 75,000 more jobs.</p>
<p>You can read the letter in full below:</p>
<p>To our shareowners:</p>
<p>One thing we&rsquo;ve learned from the COVID-19 crisis is how important Amazon has become to our customers. We want you to know we take this responsibility seriously, and we&rsquo;re proud of the work our teams are doing to help customers through this difficult time.</p>
<p>Amazonians are working around the clock to get necessary supplies delivered directly to the doorsteps of people who need them. The demand we are seeing for essential products has been and remains high. But unlike a predictable holiday surge, this spike occurred with little warning, creating major challenges for our suppliers and delivery network. We quickly prioritized the stocking and delivery of essential household staples, medical supplies, and other critical products.</p>
<p>Our Whole Foods Market stores have remained open, providing fresh food and other vital goods for customers. We are taking steps to help those most vulnerable to the virus, setting aside the first hour of shopping at Whole Foods each day for seniors. We have temporarily closed Amazon Books, Amazon 4-star, and Amazon Pop Up stores because they don&rsquo;t sell essential products, and we offered associates from those closed stores the opportunity to continue working in other parts of Amazon.</p>
<p>Crucially, while providing these essential services, we are focused on the safety of our employees and contractors around the world—we are deeply grateful for their heroic work and are committed to their health and well-being. Consulting closely with medical experts and health authorities, we&rsquo;ve made over 150 significant process changes in our operations network and Whole Foods Market stores to help teams stay healthy, and we conduct daily audits of the measures we&rsquo;ve put into place. We&rsquo;ve distributed face masks and implemented temperature checks at sites around the world to help protect employees and support staff. We regularly sanitize door handles, stairway handrails, lockers, elevator buttons, and touch screens, and disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer are standard across our network.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also introduced extensive social distancing measures to help protect our associates. We have eliminated stand-up meetings during shifts, moved information sharing to bulletin boards, staggered break times, and spread out chairs in breakrooms. While training new hires is challenging with new distancing requirements, we continue to ensure that every new employee gets six hours of safety training. We&rsquo;ve shifted training protocols so we don&rsquo;t have employees gathering in one spot, and we&rsquo;ve adjusted our hiring processes to allow for social distancing.</p>
<p>A next step in protecting our employees might be regular testing of all Amazonians, including those showing no symptoms. Regular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running. For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than is currently available. If every person could be tested regularly, it would make a huge difference in how we fight this virus. Those who test positive could be quarantined and cared for, and everyone who tests negative could re-enter the economy with confidence.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve begun the work of building incremental testing capacity. A team of Amazonians—from research scientists and program managers to procurement specialists and software engineers—moved from their normal day jobs onto a dedicated team to work on this initiative. We have begun assembling the equipment we need to build our first lab and hope to start testing small numbers of our frontline employees soon. We are not sure how far we will get in the relevant timeframe, but we think it&rsquo;s worth trying, and we stand ready to share anything we learn.</p>
<p>While we explore longer-term solutions, we are also committed to helping support employees now. We increased our minimum wage through the end of April by $2 per hour in the U.S., $2 per hour in Canada, £2 per hour in the UK, and €2 per hour in many European countries. And we are paying associates double our regular rate for any overtime worked—a minimum of $34 an hour—an increase from time and a half. These wage increases will cost more than $500 million, just through the end of April, and likely more than that over time. While we recognize this is expensive, we believe it&rsquo;s the right thing to do under the circumstances. We also established the Amazon Relief Fund—with an initial $25 million in funding—to support our independent delivery service partners and their drivers, Amazon Flex participants, and temporary employees under financial distress.</p>
<p>In March, we opened 100,000 new positions across our fulfillment and delivery network. Earlier this week, after successfully filling those roles, we announced we were creating another 75,000 jobs to respond to customer demand. These new hires are helping customers who depend on us to meet their critical needs. We know that many people around the world have suffered financially as jobs are lost or furloughed. We are happy to have them on our teams until things return to normal and either their former employer can bring them back or new jobs become available. We&rsquo;ve welcomed Joe Duffy, who joined after losing his job as a mechanic at Newark airport and learned about an opening from a friend who is an Amazon operations analyst. Dallas preschool teacher Darby Griffin joined after her school closed on March 9th and now helps manage new inventory. We&rsquo;re happy to have Darby with us until she can return to the classroom.</p>
<p>Amazon is acting aggressively to protect our customers from bad actors looking to exploit the crisis. We&rsquo;ve removed over half a million offers from our stores due to COVID-based price gouging, and we&rsquo;ve suspended more than 6,000 selling accounts globally for violating our fair-pricing policies. Amazon turned over information about sellers we suspect engaged in price gouging of products related to COVID-19 to 42 state attorneys general offices. To accelerate our response to price-gouging incidents, we created a special communication channel for state attorneys general to quickly and easily escalate consumer complaints to us.</p>
<p>Amazon Web Services is also playing an important role in this crisis. The ability for organizations to access scalable, dependable, and highly secure computing power—whether for vital healthcare work, to help students continue learning, or to keep unprecedented numbers of employees online and productive from home—is critical in this situation. Hospital networks, pharmaceutical companies, and research labs are using AWS to care for patients, explore treatments, and mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 in many other ways. Academic institutions around the world are transitioning from in-person to virtual classrooms and are running on AWS to help ensure continuity of learning. And governments are leveraging AWS as a secure platform to build out new capabilities in their efforts to end this pandemic.</p>
<p>We are collaborating with the World Health Organization, supplying advanced cloud technologies and technical expertise to track the virus, understand the outbreak, and better contain its spread. WHO is leveraging our cloud to build large-scale data lakes, aggregate epidemiological country data, rapidly translate medical training videos into different languages, and help global healthcare workers better treat patients. We are separately making a public AWS COVID-19 data lake available as a centralized repository for up-to-date and curated information related to the spread and characteristics of the virus and its associated illness so experts can access and analyze the latest data in their battle against the disease.</p>
<p>We also launched the AWS Diagnostic Development Initiative, a program to support customers working to bring more accurate diagnostic solutions to market for COVID-19. Better diagnostics help accelerate treatment and containment of this pandemic. We committed $20 million to accelerate this work and help our customers harness the cloud to tackle this challenge. While the program was established in response to COVID-19, we also are looking toward the future, and we will fund diagnostic research projects that have the potential to blunt future infectious disease outbreaks.</p>
<p>Customers around the world have leveraged the cloud to scale up services and stand up responses to COVID-19. We joined the New York City COVID-19 Rapid Response Coalition to develop a conversational agent to enable at-risk and elderly New Yorkers to receive accurate, timely information about medical and other important needs. In response to a request from the Los Angeles Unified School District to transition 700,000 students to remote learning, AWS helped establish a call center to field IT questions, provide remote support, and enable staff to answer calls. We are providing cloud services to the CDC to help thousands of public health practitioners and clinicians gather data related to COVID-19 and inform response efforts. In the UK, AWS provides the cloud computing infrastructure for a project that analyzes hospital occupancy levels, emergency room capacity, and patient wait times to help the country&rsquo;s National Health Service decide where best to allocate resources. In Canada, OTN—one of the world&rsquo;s largest virtual care networks—is scaling its AWS-powered video service to accommodate a 4,000% spike in demand to support citizens as the pandemic continues. In Brazil, AWS will provide the São Paulo State Government with cloud computing infrastructure to guarantee online classes to 1 million students in public schools across the state.</p>
<p>Following CDC guidance, our Alexa health team built an experience that lets U.S. customers check their risk level for COVID-19 at home. Customers can ask, &ldquo;Alexa, what do I do if I think I have COVID-19?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Alexa, what do I do if I think I have coronavirus?&rdquo; Alexa then asks a series of questions about the person&rsquo;s symptoms and possible exposure. Based on those responses, Alexa then provides CDC-sourced guidance. We created a similar service in Japan, based on guidance from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re making it easy for customers to use Amazon.com or Alexa to donate directly to charities on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis, including Feeding America, the American Red Cross, and Save the Children. Echo users have the option to say, &ldquo;Alexa, make a donation to Feeding America COVID-19 Response Fund.&rdquo; In Seattle, we&rsquo;ve partnered with a catering business to distribute 73,000 meals to 2,700 elderly and medically vulnerable residents in Seattle and King County during the outbreak, and we donated 8,200 laptops to help Seattle Public Schools students gain access to a device while classes are conducted virtually.

<h3 id="amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-annual-shareholder-letter-once-an-insightful-must-read-has-turned-cautious-and-promotional-as-the-company-faces-more-scrutiny">Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos&rsquo; annual shareholder letter, once an insightful must-read, has turned cautious and promotional as the company faces more scrutiny</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.insider.com/5e76cbc8671de07fd1039563?width=1200&amp;format=jpeg" alt="img">
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos published his annual shareholder letter on Thursday.</p>
<p>Bezos&rsquo; letter has become a must-read among business leaders for its ingenuity and thought-provoking advice.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s letter, however, mostly focused on Amazon&rsquo;s work in helping its employees and other businesses amid the COVID-19 pandemic — a departure from previous years&rsquo; letters, which were full of inspiring anecdotes and business guidance.</p>
<p>Some people say Bezos&rsquo; annual shareholder letter is losing its luster as the company is more cautious about what it says publicly in light of increased regulatory and press scrutiny.</p>

<p>Visit Business Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>Jeff Bezos&rsquo; annual shareholder letter was once considered a must-read in business circles for the unparalleled insights it gave into the Amazon CEO&rsquo;s leadership principles and long-term thinking — not so anymore.</p>
<p>The highly regarded Amazon shareholder letter, published every year since it went public in 1997, seems to have lost its luster. It is now primarily used to promote the company&rsquo;s work and carefully worded to minimize the growing regulatory scrutiny on Amazon, business leaders say.</p>
<p>For example, this year&rsquo;s letter, published on Thursday, reads more like a giant press release, with Bezos listing what Amazon has done so far to help its employees and other businesses amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Last year&rsquo;s letter was similarly defensive and mostly covered Amazon&rsquo;s role in growing small-business owners on its marketplace.</p>
<p>The change is a departure from previous letters that were filled with genuine anecdotes and thought-provoking business advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a really boring letter,&rdquo; Paul Argenti, who teaches corporate communications at Dartmouth College, said, referring to this year&rsquo;s shareholder letter. &ldquo;It shows Bezos has a bigger fish to fry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Argenti said the change was a natural progression for Amazon, which has become one of the most powerful companies and is run by the richest man. Only a handful of high-profile CEOs, like Berkshire Hathaway&rsquo;s Warren Buffett and JPMorgan&rsquo;s Jamie Dimon, still manage to write insightful shareholder letters, which shows the difficulty in keeping it as a distinctive part of company culture.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good&rsquo; company</p>
<p>But more importantly, it&rsquo;s likely a reflection of Amazon&rsquo;s desire to stay out of unwanted press and regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<p>The letter comes at a time when Amazon is facing an onslaught of challenges related to the coronavirus pandemic. Supply-chain lockdowns have caused massive shipment delays, while groups of employees and lawmakers are criticizing the company&rsquo;s weak safety measures for warehouse and delivery workers. On top of that, Amazon was already dealing with unprecedented regulatory pressure over its growing market power.</p>
<p>Anand Sanwal, the CEO of the financial-research firm CB Insights who wrote an analysis of every Amazon shareholder letter last year, said the watered-down language could help avoid unnecessary attention to its business practices, especially at a time when the company&rsquo;s every move is being scrutinized.</p>
<p>For example, Bezos wrote in 1998 about the importance of being &ldquo;terrified&rdquo; of customers to underscore the importance of providing good customer service, one of his key leadership principles. If he wrote the term &ldquo;terrified of customers&rdquo; today, the nuance behind it would be lost and instead lead to &ldquo;inaccurate agenda-driven sound bite,&rdquo; Sanwal said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why bother writing something of business value, which will be received positively by a small minority of business and tech nerds, just to invite scrutiny and have 99.9% of the response be negative?&rdquo; Sanwal added.</p>
<p>The change in tone of the letter is particularly interesting, according to Sucharita Kodali, an analyst at Forrester Research. If prior letters had focused on Amazon&rsquo;s business acumen, this year&rsquo;s letter is more focused on its corporate benevolence, emphasizing the good things it&rsquo;s doing for the broader economy. That&rsquo;s likely because of the growing chorus of criticism over Amazon&rsquo;s treatment of workers and mentions of antitrust laws, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tone now is, &lsquo;We are a company that does good,&rsquo; versus, &lsquo;We are doing well as a company,'&rdquo; Kodali said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Optimistic&rsquo; outlook</p>
<p>While this year&rsquo;s letter is disappointing compared with the previous ones, it still provides some interesting updates to Amazon&rsquo;s business, according to Andrew Murphy, an analyst at Loup Ventures.</p>
<p>Bezos said in the letter that he planned to eventually offer regular COVID-19 testing for all Amazon employees. He added that his own time and thinking &ldquo;continues to be focused on COVID-19 and how Amazon can help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murphy said the letter also confirmed that coronavirus-related shopping demand remained high for Amazon, as Bezos compared it to the holiday season. More broadly, it showed Amazon has become an essential part of mainstream America, touching everyday lives through not only shopping but also job creation and renewable energy, Murphy said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the first time Bezos has used the letter to defend specific aspects of Amazon&rsquo;s business, according to Andrea Leigh, a former Amazon manager who&rsquo;s now the vice president of strategy at Ideoclick. In 2005, Bezos explained Amazon&rsquo;s push to offer lower prices at the expense of lower profits. The 2010 letter was used to defend Amazon&rsquo;s increased investment in its cloud business. Given the broadened shareholder base, it makes sense for Bezos to address specific issues through the annual letter, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amazon&rsquo;s obviously become much more high profile in recent years, so it would make sense that the letter is written with more PR value in mind,&rdquo; Leigh said.</p>
<p>Still, not all readers were disappointed by Bezos&rsquo; letter. Parsa Saljoughian, a partner at the venture-investment firm IVP, said while this year&rsquo;s letter clearly read &ldquo;differently&rdquo; than previous ones, it&rsquo;s the most meaningful of them all because it gives a look into Amazon&rsquo;s impact on the broader world.</p>
<p>Saljoughian, who previously wrote a blog post about reading every Amazon shareholder letter, said he was particularly impressed by the way Bezos ended his letter this year.</p>
<p>Bezos asked shareholders to reflect on Theodor Seuss Geisel&rsquo;s quote, &ldquo;When something bad happens you have three choices. You can either let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very optimistic about which of these civilization is going to choose,&rdquo; Bezos wrote.
