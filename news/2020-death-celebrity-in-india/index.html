While Bollywood is yet to come to terms with the sudden demise of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, one thing that has become clear is that the life of a celebrity is never easy.</p>
<p>Always under the spotlight and public scrutiny, the air kisses and big bungalows are all a facade like the glamour and glitz that accompanies this profession.</p>
<p>Sushant was found dead in his sixth-floor apartment in Bandra (West) this afternoon. Police are investigating the case as a suicide. However, no ‘suicide note’ was found from his residence. He made his debut with Kai Po Che in 2013 and later starred in films such as Shuddh Desi Romance, PK, and MS Dhoni: The Untold Journey and Kedarnath. He was last seen in Netflix’s Drive. He made his acting debut with Zee TV serial Pavitra Rishta. MS Dhoni, in which he played the former Indian cricket team captain, was among the most successful film of 2016. He garnered critical acclaim for his role in Dibakar Banerjee’s 2015 movie, Detective Byomkesh Bakshy.</p>

<h3 id="rana-ayyub-indian-celebrities-embrace-black-lives-matter-exposing-a-deep-hypocrisy">&ldquo;Rana Ayyub: Indian celebrities embrace Black Lives Matter, exposing a deep hypocrisy&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M5FPWURISYI6VHGJ4GOPXSD6KE.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
That same evening, an Indian court denied the bail application of Safoora Zargar, a 27-year-old Kashmiri student activist who is five months pregnant and has been in jail while suffering complications due to polycystic ovary syndrome.</p>
<p>Doctors fear a possible miscarriage that could endanger Zargar’s life. She has been in the dreaded Tihar Jail in New Delhi for two months for allegedly conspiring to obstruct law enforcement during February’s nationwide student protests against the discriminatory Citizenship Amendment Bill, which brazenly excludes Muslim migrants.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The judge scolded the activist, saying that “when you choose to play with embers, you cannot blame the wind to have carried the spark a bit too far.” Now Zargar, who stood up to the tyranny and communal bias of the Indian state, has been booked under the draconian Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for terrorism and instigating riots in the national capital — all for exposing the country’s moral bankruptcy.</p>
<p>A country that rose in solidarity for a dead elephant looks the other way as Zargar waits in an overcrowded prison during a pandemic.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>As many Indians wear the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag as a fashion accessory, they remain oblivious to the fact that the ugly faces of majoritarian privilege and discrimination have been present in their home country for a long, long time. As demonstrators around the world mobilized against the brutal killing of George Floyd and conversations on race spread, Indian celebrities found a safe cause. Indian actor Priyanka Chopra, who is a global icon, shared Floyd’s last words, “Please, I can’t breathe,” on her Instagram account to express her pain and anger.</p>
<p>But where have these celebrities been when Indian Muslims have been systematically targeted by a majoritarian regime and a prejudiced legal system? As an Indian Muslim, I see the use of #BlackLivesMatter not as an extension of real solidarity, but as a reflection of the moral disfigurement of a population that looks the other way when its own minorities are discriminated against and lynched. Where were they when, during the Delhi carnage in February, police officials thrashed and beat to death Muslim men while demanding they chant the national anthem? Do Chopra and Tata even know their names? What about solidarity with the 15-year-old who was lynched for wearing a Muslim cap? Where was the outrage when a cabinet minister honored a group of killers who lynched a young Muslim man?</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>But the public voices now tweeting “Black Lives Matter” maintained a silence that was nauseating. When asked questions by the media, many chose to praise the government’s response.</p>
<p>Some Indian activists have started using the hashtags #MuslimLivesMatter, #DalitlivesMatter, #KashmiriLivesmatter to draw the world’s attention to the excesses being committed against marginalized populations in India. Within a day, one of India’s leading news channels, Times Now, distorted the tweets as part of an effort to destabilize the country.</p>
<p>On June 4, feminists across the world expressed solidarity with two activists from the feminist organization Pinjra Tod who were arrested, accused of causing riots in Delhi. But you’d be hard-pressed to find expressions of concern and solidarity from celebrities and regular people.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>India has its share of heroes — students, activists like Zargar, and some journalists — willing to stand up to protect the country’s moral compass. As I write this column, journalists in Kashmir face terror charges for reporting the truth and criticizing the Modi regime. These brave voices are fighting a lonely battle — but, unlike in the United States, no significant part of the citizenry is joining their struggle.</p>
<p>It’s time Indians stop worshiping false heroes and correct the course of our languishing democracy. The events of the last week have exposed a brutal double standard, as we remain indifferent to the trauma of Zargar and thousands like her, who have faced systemic injustice for generations.</p>

Image Source : INSTAGRAM/SUSHMITASEN Sushmita Sen pens down an emotional post after Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s death, says, &lsquo;never give up&rsquo;</p>
<p>The country was left in shock after the news of actor Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s suicide started doing rounds. The 34-year-old Bollywood actor was found hanging at his Bandra residence on June 14. When there was no response after repeated knocks, his domestic help called the neighbours after which police arrived shortly and broke into his room where he was found hanging around 12.30 pm. It came to light that he was suffering from depression and was even getting treatment from Hinduja hospital for the last six months. After the untimely death of the stay, various celebrities were left in shock and had only one question as to why he took the drastic step. One amongst those was actress Sushmita Sen who took to her social media to share a long post and spoke about how it is important to stay positive in life because a person is only responsible for his own happiness. She even spoke about how insecurities can grow in the life of a celebrity with name and sometimes, bank balance.</p>
<p>Sushmita shared a photo that read, &lsquo;protect your peace.&rsquo; Alongside she wrote the long post reading, &ldquo;Look good, show good&hellip;be good..ALL THE TIME!! Projection becomes one’s life, both on &amp; off screen. Insecurities grow with name &amp; sometimes, bank balance. All these may be known triggers in an actors life&hellip;but it’s actually true about a lot of us from all different walks of life&hellip;only differing in magnitude &amp; visibility!! Young people with so much life &amp; promise ahead of them, some with great depth &amp; will power&hellip;can choose to take their own life is deeply disturbing. How do we say, we know people &amp; still not see it coming? Have we become experts at hiding our pain or does no one have the time to really SEE it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further, she said, &ldquo;How lonely &amp; hopeless can prolonged silence make you? Do we alienate a life by judging it constantly? In the race of the projection of “look good, show good, be good” have we lost the most important ability to FEEL GOOD? Life has its share of pressures for EVERYONE&hellip;no one is excused that, no matter what your standing!! Life is a graph with its ups &amp; downs for EVERYONE, even if we can’t always see it. Yet, FIGHT FOR LIFE WE MUST&hellip;it’s the only vehicle that will help lead us from bad times to GOOD ONES again!!! “WHEN YOU’RE TIRED&hellip; LEARN TO REST, NOT QUIT.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She also wrote about how building a life takes a lot of faith and courage while taking one&rsquo;s life just needs a moment of madness. She said, &ldquo;We can’t change the world, but we can choose self preservation over the noise, chaos, demands, insensitive scrutinisation &amp; conditioned insecurities&hellip;.by befriending ourselves, being around people who really LISTEN, having faith in God’s unique plan JUST FOR YOU!!! Be unafraid to ask for help &amp; know that you are NOT ALONE. Building a life demands a lot of faith, courage, resilience &amp; hard work&hellip;whereas taking your life just needs a MOMENT of madness&hellip;choose to distract yourself from THAT moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the professional front, Sushmita will be making her &lsquo;incredible&rsquo; comeback through her upcoming web series &lsquo;Aarya&rsquo; in which she will be seen playing the role of a mother who is willing to go to any length to protect her children. The show also features Namit Das, Sikandar Kher, Jayant Kripalani, Sohaila Kapoor, Sugandha Garg, Maya Sareen, Vishwajeet Pradhan and Manish Chaudhary. It is directed by Ram Madhwani, is scheduled to hit Disney+ Hotstar VIP on the 19th of June 2020.</p>
