A Senior New South Wales Police Officer has issued a warning to the cast of Channel Nine&rsquo;s Married At First Sight not to &lsquo;waste their time with trivial complaints&rsquo;.</p>
<p>According to The Sunday Telegraph, the unnamed officer said overworked staff are &lsquo;bemused and frustrated&rsquo; when stars arrive to file reports with paparazzi in tow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has happened a lot this year. We take all police reports seriously, but what&rsquo;s happening with MAFS contestants is a gee-up. We are in the midst of 24/7 dramas,&rsquo; the anonymous police officer said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are in the midst of 24/7 dramas&rsquo;: A Senior New South Wales Police Officer has issued a warning to the cast of Channel Nine&rsquo;s Married At First Sight not to &lsquo;waste their time with trivial complaints&rsquo;. Pictured: Mikey Pembroke filming the show on October 22 in Sydney</p>
<p>The police source said they plan on speaking to Channel Nine, production company Endemol Shine Australia and celebrity agents about this going forward.</p>
<p>They want the contestants to &lsquo;be warned&rsquo; about wasting police time and resources.</p>
<p>In recent months, current star Natasha Spencer filed a complaint after a nude video of her leaked, and Mike Pembroke filed a complaint over online threats.</p>

Pictured: Former star Nasser Sultan at Redfern Police Station in May 2018</p>
<p>They follow a string of complaints from contestants on previous seasons, with most of them photographed by paparazzi as they exit police stations.</p>
<p>There is no suggestion the stars tip-off photographers themselves.</p>
<p>Instead, the source believes it is possibly their agents &lsquo;trying to get them some cash for stories&rsquo; and drum up publicity, likely without their knowledge.</p>
<p>Complaints: In recent months, current star Natasha Spencer (R) filed a complaint after a nude video of her leaked, and Mike Pembroke (L) filed a complaint over online threats</p>
<p>The source concluded: &lsquo;I have cautioned commanders not to be dismissive of reports, but to be mindful that paps will often be present when someone presents because they were coming thick and fast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted NSW Police and Channel Nine for comment.

Steve O’Keefe calls time on his first-class career after NSW contract snub</p>
<p>He ended his FC career with 301 wickets in 88 matches.</p>
<p>Australia spinner Steve O’Keefe has decided to retire from first-class cricket with immediate effect. The New South Wales (NSW) decided not to offer him a contract for the next summer which led to him taking this decision. O’Keefe has been one of the best spinners in Australia‘s domestic circuit having picked 301 wickets in his 88-match FC career at an impeccable average of 24.66.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old accounted for 224 scalps while playing for the New South Wales in 71 matches in the Sheffield Shield. He also played nine Test matches for Australia picking 35 wickets, 12 of which came in the Pune Test against India during the 2017 tour. Steve O’Keefe was disappointed for not getting a contract but his not so great disciplinary record might have also paved the way for this decision.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>However, he thanked the NSW Cricket and all the people involved including his family and friends for supporting him during his 15-year career. “I was disappointed when I was told that I wasn’t getting a contract but I respect and accept the decision, so I have decided to retire from first-class cricket.</p>
<p>“I will forever be grateful to Lee [Germon, the Cricket NSW chief executive] and all the staff, from the front office to the warehouse to the development officers in regional areas, who have all shared the same passion for the game. They’ve played a huge role in making the last 15 years so memorable. And, of course, I am indebted to the fans, who supported my left-arm inswingers against their better judgement.</p>
<p>“On a personal level, I want to thank my family, as well as my manager and friend, Andrew Fraser. They’ve been by my side through everything and I couldn’t have done this without them. It’s been such a privilege to play for my country and captain my state, but above everything else, I’m most proud to have played alongside some of the best blokes I’ve ever met. When I think about my time playing cricket, that’s what I’ll miss most,” he was quoted as saying by ESPNCricinfo.</p>
<p>Steve O’Keefe to continue playing the BBL</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Steve O’Keefe will be playing in the Big Bash League (BBL), Australia’s premier T20 competition. He features for the Sydney Sixers in the tournament, the team which won the previous season by defeating the Melbourne Stars at the SCG in the rain-affected final. The left-arm spinner picked seven wickets in the nine matches he played conceding runs at a wily economy of just 6.92.

<h3 id="easter-travel-ruled-out-for-australians">Easter travel ruled out for Australians</h3>
<p><img src="https://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e400669b-998c-43b3-b6b1-98d2afff1df5.jpg/r0_74_800_526_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg" alt="img">
news, national</p>
<p>Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy is pleading with Australians to forgo their usual Easter festivities next weekend and stick to social distancing measures to try to curb the spread of the coronavirus. At least 34 Australians have now died from COVID-19, including four new fatalities in NSW, but a number of states have reported lower numbers of cases. Professor Murphy said there were now 5687 cases across the country, a rise of 139 over the last 24 hours and probably the lowest that has been seen in the past few days. However, about 10 per cent of these cases is where there is no known contact with another case. &ldquo;I may sound like a broken record at times but community transmission is what worries me most of all,&rdquo; Prof Murphy told reporters in Canberra on Sunday. &ldquo;Those are the reasons we have brought in the social distancing measures and all of those measures to stop the spread.&rdquo; He said Easter was a time when people normally travelled, got together and had social gatherings but &ldquo;we&rsquo;re asking you not to do that&rdquo;. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re asking you to stay with your family, in your residence, not travel where you might be unwittingly spreading the virus, not have parties where you might unwittingly be sharing the virus with people who don&rsquo;t have it,&rdquo; he said. However, there was a rare light-hearted moment about the Easter Bunny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m told because he&rsquo;s a solo operator and an essential service, he or she, will be allowed to continue to operate,&rdquo; he quipped. Queensland reported a fall in confirmed cases for the fourth day in a row, with just nine reported overnight. Victoria recorded just 20 new cases, while NSW - the hardest-hit state - recorded 87 new cases, bringing the state&rsquo;s total to 2580. South Australian deputy chief medical officer Dr Michael Cusack was cautious about the low numbers. &ldquo;I guess people have less checks and tests over weekends so I wouldn&rsquo;t want to read too much into this but we have seen a gradual decline in recent days.&rdquo; Using an AFL metaphor to describe the path of the COVID-19 ahead, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Nick Coatsworth said Australia was at the end of the first quarter in the grand final and a goal ahead. &ldquo;We know that if we work as a team and play as we are now, we can get the premiership, but we are a long way away from that being the case,&rdquo; he told Sky News. &ldquo;It is far too early to drop the ball and &hellip;. if we do stop these measures too early, then we have seen graphs in the media showing there could be a resurgence in cases so we have to be careful on those grounds.&rdquo; A number of the cases and deaths came from cruise ships, including the Ruby Princess which was allowed to disembark passengers in Sydney before results of onboard swab tests from the cruise ship&rsquo;s passengers were known. A total of 622 passengers onboard have tested positive for COVID-19 including 342 NSW residents. Some of those passengers have since died, including three of the four cases in NSW overnight. Meanwhile, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has warned against using dodgy, imported home COVID-19 test kits, saying they pose to a risk to public health. A number of these kits from China and Hong Kong have been intercepted by Australian Border Force officers in the past few weeks. He warned using these kits would undermine the vital, lifesaving work of health professionals. &ldquo;Inaccurate results could prevent people from seeking the medical help they need, or alternatively, discourage people who should be self-isolating from doing so,&rdquo; Mr Dutton said.
