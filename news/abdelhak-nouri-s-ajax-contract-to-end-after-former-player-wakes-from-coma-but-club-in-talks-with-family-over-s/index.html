Ajax are poised to end the contract of Abdelhak Nouri after he woke from a coma as they continue talks with his family over a settlement fee.</p>
<p>Nouri suffered a cardiac arrhythmia during a pre-season friendly against Werder Bremen in 2017.</p>
<p>3 Nouri collapsed during a pre-season friendly vs Werder Bremen in 2017</p>
<p>He was revived on the pitch, but left with permanent brain damage and fell into a coma for two years and nine months.</p>
<p>Nouri’s Ajax contract, which has been paid in full by the club since the tragic incident, expires this summer.</p>
<p>Dutch outlet De Telegraaf claim the 22-year-old’s contract has a pre-agreed 12-month extension that the club will not follow through with.</p>
<p>Instead, Ajax are believed to be in negotiations with his family over a settlement.</p>
<p>Last week, Ajax were reportedly planning on offering Nouri’s family £4.5million after admitting their on-pitch medical treatment of the player was ‘inadequate’.</p>
<p>3 Abdelhak Nouri made 12 first-team appearances for Ajax</p>
<p>And the Royal Dutch Football Association’s arbitration panel stated his brain damage was caused due to the failure to resuscitate him quickly enough.</p>
<p>In 2018, Ajax general manager Edwin Van der Sar said: “We recognise our responsibility and liability for the consequences of this.</p>
<p>“For a long time we were convinced that Abdelhak had received the best possible care on the field.”</p>
<p>However, it is understood Nouri’s family are holding out for a much bigger payout than £4.5million.</p>
<p>On Friday, it was announced that Nouri had woken from his coma.</p>
<p>getty images 3 Van der Sar admitted Ajax’s ‘responsibility’ and ‘liability’ to Abdelhak Nouri</p>
<p>His brother, Abderrahim, said: “He has not been home very long, we take care of him there now.</p>
<p>“I must say that since he is at home it is going much better than before in the hospital.</p>
<p>“He is aware of where he is, he is back in a familiar environment with his family.</p>
<p>“He’s no longer in a coma. He’s very bedridden and still very dependent on us.”</p>
<p>Nouri made 12 first-team appearances for Ajax after coming through their esteemed academy.

<h3 id="ajax-footballer-abdelhak-nouri-awakes-from-coma-after-32-months">Ajax footballer Abdelhak Nouri awakes from coma after 32 months</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2020/3/27/87271b35ecd54c16a611f386537b7129_18.jpg" alt="img">
Abdelhak Nouri, a midfielder for Dutch football giants Ajax, has woken from a coma after two years, eight months and 19 days.</p>
<p>The player&rsquo;s brother Abderrahim said the 22-year-old woke up and showed signs of life, Dutch daily De Telegraaf reported late on Thursday.</p>
<p>More:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is going well with Appie [Abdelhak]. Yes, what is good? He&rsquo;s awake, he&rsquo;s asleep, he&rsquo;s eating, he&rsquo;s burping, but he&rsquo;s not getting out of bed,&rdquo; Abderrahim told the Amsterdam-based newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At good times there is a form of communication, then he moves his eyebrows. He just can&rsquo;t keep it up for long, that seems to be top sport for him,&rdquo; he said, adding that Nouri was at home with his family and &ldquo;aware of where he is&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Cardiac arrest</p>
<p>The Dutch-Moroccan midfielder collapsed during a friendly match between Ajax and Germany&rsquo;s Werder Bremen on July 8, 2017 in Austria due to a cardiac arrest, which caused serious brain damage.</p>
<p>Amsterdam-based Ajax were later forced to admit that their on-field treatment of the player was inadequate. Club doctor Don de Winter was fired.</p>
<p>Winter is believed to have deviated from UEFA&rsquo;s guidelines, beginning resuscitation attempts too late. Ajax Chief Executive Edwin van der Sar said at the time a defibrillator should &ldquo;have been used sooner&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had this happened, it&rsquo;s possible that Abdelhak would have come out in a better condition,&rdquo; Van der Sar had said in a statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t certain, but it&rsquo;s a possibility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We recognise our responsibility and liability for the consequences of this.&rdquo;

<p>Nouri&rsquo;s brother confirmed this week that he is out of the coma and able to communicate with family after going home.</p>
<p>Journalist Valentijn Driessen has claimed a compensation fee has not been agreed between the club and the player&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Dutch side are considering an offer of £4.5m.</p>
<p>But Driessen allegedly added: &ldquo;Nouri&rsquo;s family want to have significantly more.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2018, Ajax admitted to providing &ldquo;inadequate&rdquo; care on the pitch after Nouri collapsed.</p>
<p>He was revived and airlifted to hospital, but suffered brain damage as a result of the attack.</p>
<p>At the time, Ajax chief Edwin van der Sar said: &ldquo;We recognise our responsibility and liability for the consequences of this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a long time we were convinced that Abdelhak had received the best possible care on the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Demba Ba was among the long-list of players that paid tribute to the talented Dutchman this week.
