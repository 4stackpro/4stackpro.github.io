Sam Smith sends ‘nothing but love’ to everyone amid the backlash (Picture: Sam Smith, Instagram)</p>
<p>Sam Smith is holding their head high after being dragged on social media over their quarantine ‘meltdown’ and is all about love.</p>
<p>The Dancing With a Stranger singer became the subject of backlash when critics compared their Instagram post in which they cried about the lockdown to war veteran Captain Tom Moore, who has raised over £15 million for the NHS at the age of 99.</p>
<p>Seemingly responding to the criticism, Sam posted: ‘Sending nothing but love to everyone out there today,’ alongside a heart emoji.</p>
<p>In an Instagram live on Wednesday evening (16 April), the pop star admitted they were feeling ‘a bit down’ after the government confirmed the UK’s coronavirus lockdown has been extended by three weeks.</p>
<p>‘I’ve been a bit down today because it’s feeling real,’ Sam explained. ‘It’s been quite a day coming to terms with that.</p>

<p>‘I’m running out of things to do. I think the more you sleep, the more tired I am because I’m absolutely shattered. I can’t complain right now. I’ve got my health and my family.’</p>

<p>Sam praised the NHS for their work on the frontlines during an Instagram live (Picture: Sam Smith, Instagram)</p>
<p>They went on to address the NHS and other frontline workers fighting Covid-19 and said: ‘What’s getting me down is just thinking about everyone working out there right now on the frontline. I can’t even begin to imagine how hard that is and traumatic to be witnessing the effects of things up front.</p>
<p>‘I just want to say thank you from the most purest part of my heart because you’re saving us.</p>
<p>‘I really hope you get paid more after this and you get the respect that you deserve.’</p>
<p>The 27-year-old singer became a trending topic on Twitter after they complained about being in self-isolation during the coronavirus pandemic last month.</p>
<p>‘Stages of a quarantine meltdown,’ they captioned the image which shows them with their head bowed in despair.</p>
<p>Critics used Sam’s post to show the contrast against Captain Tom, who has become a national treasure and hero after successfully completing 100 laps around his garden to raise money for the NHS fighting on the coronavirus frontlines.</p>

<p>Captain Tom, who served in the Second World War, has incredibly raised more than £15 million for the healthcare service and vows to continue doing laps until the donations stop.</p>

<p>‘Do people realise that you can praise and have admiration for the INCREDIBLE #SirTomMoore while not shitting on others like Sam Smith?’ a Twitter user questioned, adding: ‘Stop comparing how people are dealing with this situation. You can support heros like Tom and NHS workers AND support those struggling with MH [mental health].’</p>
<p>Calling out the critics, another weighed in: ‘The veteran raising £££ for the NHS is amazing &amp; rightly being applauded. Using his achievement to troll Sam Smith &amp; mock their suffering is disgraceful. Rich, successful ppl experience the whole spectrum of MH issues too, partic in these surreal circumstances. Remember #bekind?’</p>
<p>The backlash prompted fans of the singer to remind the trolls of the #BeKind movement sparked after Caroline Flack’s tragic death by suicide in February.</p>

As part of our Hot Press &lsquo;Stay Safe&rsquo; Emergency issue, global superstar Sam Smith reflects on life during lockdown.</p>
<p>WE HAVE TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT ALL</p>
<p>Like all of us, I’m spending my days indoors, bored – but also wracked with guilt and worry for everyone out there who is risking their lives for us. It’s a hard one for everyone, and everything’s relative I think. I have mental health issues, so I’m just trying to keep my head above water right now, like so many of us. But it’s just a weird time. I hope everyone’s okay and coping.</p>
<p>OCD AND COVID</p>
<p>I have OCD, which I’ve had since I’ve been a kid, and since I became well-known it’s gotten way worse. Because it’s a control thing and – with what I do, the lack of control within my life became very intense. For me, I’ve been on the road and travelling around the world and touring since I was 20 years old. This is the first time that I’ve had to clean my clothes and look after myself as a human being! And obviously these are very privileged problems. But you know, this lack of control sends my OCD absolutely wild.</p>
<p>It manifests as obsessive thoughts; I’ll see a picture or a film and I’ll obsess over it for days, to the point where I’m crippled by it. As an illness, OCD is very misunderstood. People claim to have it when they’re just cleaning their rooms and they’re tidy, but it’s actually a little more intense. It can turn into violent imagery, violent sexual imagery, so it’s a mountain to climb, constantly.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>CREATIVITY IN WAVES</p>
<p>For all of us now, the world is so busy and so manic all the time, it’s just constant, and with technology nowadays it’s even more intense, in that you have to be constantly connected and in a hundred places at once. This stillness, I think, puts you face to face with your demons, and with your self. So I think we have to make the most out of it. But then the pressure to make the most out of it becomes very intense, too!</p>
<p>Creativity is coming in waves right now for me. Last week, I had this beautiful moment where I started enjoying singing again: just singing for the joy of singing myself. And then this week, I just do not want to sing at all. So I think we just have to be so easy on ourselves.</p>
<p>IN KEEPING WITH THE TIMES</p>
<p>As everything started happening in the world, with everyone going on, I started to feel less and less okay with the fact that I was bringing out this pop album. It just felt very, very vibrant and loud. And I’m an empath as a person, and was starting to feel weird about that, given the heaviness everyone has been feeling.</p>
<p>And then having the title ‘To Die For’ and the front cover is a bunch of people touching my face: it’s absolutely not the message I want to be giving right now! So I’m changing the album title so it feels fresh to me and fitting. I write music all the time, non-stop, and I have a few songs that I’ve written that are more in keeping with everything. I’m just so aware that many of my fans would have lost people through this, and have been through hard times, and I wanted to keep it in line with everything.</p>
<p>In conversation with Roe McDermott.</p>

<h3 id="sam-smith-demi-lovato-announce-im-ready-for-love-with-new-song">Sam Smith, Demi Lovato Announce ‘I’m Ready’ for Love With New Song</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/samsmithdemi.jpg" alt="img">
Sam Smith and Demi Lovato are ready to accept love on with empowering new single “I’m Ready.” The track will appear on Smith’s upcoming album, which they recently postponed.</p>
<p>On the song, Smith and Lovato detail what they’re looking for in their ideal partners: someone who is loyal, strong and worthy of their affection. More importantly, both announce that they are finally ready to take the risk. “I’m ready, I’m ready, I’m ready, I’m ready for someone to love me,” they sing on the chorus. By the end, a full choir amplifies the pair’s message. Jora Frantzis (Cardi B, Rosalía) directed the video, which features Smith and Lovato competing in a series of Olympic events alongside a star-studded cast of LGBTQ performers and drag stars, including RuPaul’s Drag Race contestants Valentina and Gigi Goode.</p>
<p>Smith’s third album was originally titled To Die For and slated for June 5th release. On March 30th, the singer announced that they have decided to rename the LP and postpone it due to the coronavirus pandemic. They stressed in a message to their fans that the album would still arrive this year but have yet to announce a new title.</p>
<p>Lovato made her return to music earlier this year when she debuted the ballad “Anyone” at the Grammy Awards. It was her first performance since enduring a near-fatal overdose in 2018. She followed the ballad with more a more uplifting proclamation on the song “I Love Me.” Later this year, she will star alongside Will Ferrell, Rachel McAdams and Pierce Brosnan in the Netflix film Eurovision.
