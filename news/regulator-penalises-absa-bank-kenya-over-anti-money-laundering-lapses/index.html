<p>NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya’s central bank has ordered Absa Bank Kenya to stop foreign exchange dealing between April 9 and April 15 for failing to observe anti money-laundering rules on some trades.</p>
<p>The central bank said it took action over foreign exchange trades Absa Bank carried out in March and said Absa had also failed to satisfactorily make “know your customer” checks.</p>
<p>“Absa Kenya is required to &hellip; reverse the market positions that were created as a result of the flagged transactions,” the central bank said in a statement on Thursday. It did not give any details of the trades involved.</p>
<p>In response Absa Kenya said its parent Absa Group and all its subsidiaries had strict anti money-laundering policies and on combating the financing of terrorism. It also said know-your-customer policies were applied in all their businesses.</p>
<p>The central bank said Absa would also be required by April 15 to have put in place stronger measures to make sure all documentation needed for foreign exchange transactions was available and followed the regulations.</p>
<p>It said Absa Bank could settle all its transactions as of April 8. “Absa Kenya’s acknowledgement of its obligations as an authorised foreign exchange dealer and its commitment to address the underlying issues is noted,” the central bank said.</p>
<p>Absa Kenya said that when the central bank raised its concerns it had stopped two foreign exchange forward transactions it was carrying out for two unnamed reputable global financial institutions while it addressed the regulator’s concerns.</p>
<p>“The transactions were executed at prevailing market rates. The decision to cancel the transactions was taken to demonstrate our willingness to address fully the concerns of the regulator,” Absa Kenya said.</p>
<p>“We are in ongoing consultations and discussions with the Central Bank of Kenya to fully resolve all matters raised in the shortest possible time.”

<h3 id="absa-kenya-formerly-barclays-bank-kenya-waives-all-digital-transaction-fees-for-90-days-amid-coronavirus-pandemic">ABSA Kenya, Formerly Barclays Bank Kenya, Waives All Digital Transaction Fees for 90 Days Amid Coronavirus Pandemic</h3>

Following a Kenyan government directive, Absa Kenya, formerly Barclays Bank Kenya, becomes yet another major institution in Kenya, after Safaricom, to waive all digital transaction costs below a certain limit in order to encourage use of cashless methods amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>In emails and text messages to clients, the bank has discouraged the use of physical cash and pushing its clients to move digital.</p>

<p>A few days ago, Safaricom, Kenya’s largest telcom and operator of the largest mobile money platform in Africa, M-PESA, made a similar move by eliminating transaction fees for small amounts and increasing daily digital transaction limits in order to encourage cashless transactions.</p>
<p>While this publication has advocated for the use of digital payments like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies since inception, it is commendable to see this move gain momentum with this directive in a bid to not only reduce infection rates of the virus, but also make it more seamless to transact and trade.</p>
<p>UPDATE: The Central Bank of Kenya has announces a set of measures that commercial banks will undertake in order to alleviate the adverse economic effects their customers may face. See the full statement here.</p>

<h3 id="absa-posts-ksh85-billion-normalized-2019-profit">Absa posts Ksh.8.5 billion normalized 2019 profit</h3>
<p><img src="https://3dwnh01icn0h133s00sokwo1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture1.jpg" alt="img">
Absa Bank Kenya has reported a normalized Ksh.8.5 billion profit after tax for the period ending December 31, 2019 on the back of higher operating income.</p>
<p>The lender, formerly known as Barclays Bank of Kenya returned a profit before tax and exemptions of Ksh.12.3 billion from Ksh.10.6 in 2018.</p>
<p>“We have begun seeing fruits from our investments in automation to not just efficiency in operations but also to better customer experience.” Absa Kenya Managing Director Jeremy Awori said in a call to investors.</p>
<p>Now known as Absa Kenya, the bank said its one off transition costs stood at Ksh.1.5 billion at the end of the period under review.</p>
<p>The lender’s total operating income stood at Ksh.33.8 billion in the period from Ksh.31.7 billion as both interest and non-interest income grew by six and 9.3 percent respectively</p>
<p>Absa’s loans and advances grew to Ksh194.9 billion from Ksh.177.4 billion in 2018 with investment in government securities rising by 25.3 per cent to Ksh.79.2 billion.</p>
<p>Total operating expenses in the period meanwhile held up at Ksh.21.5 billion from a flat Ksh.21 billion.</p>
<p>In the period, non-performing loans (NPLs) slid by 2.9 per cent to Ksh.13.5 billion attributed to efficiencies in dealing with customers.</p>
<p>“A significant portion of our loan book is secured in areas such as mortgages and asset financing. This has allowed us to safeguard our NPL ratios,” noted Absa Kenya Chief Finance Officer Yusuf Omari.</p>
<p>Absa Kenya now says it is in a position to grow its business, echoing ongoing mergers and acquisition in the Kenyan banking space.</p>
<p>“We are always on the lookout for an attractive acquisition. The reality however is that we have a duty to shareholders,” added Awori.</p>
<p>The bank has retained its dividend per share at Ksh.1.10 for the year as the company’s stock holds its earning per share (EPS) at Ksh.1.37.</p>
