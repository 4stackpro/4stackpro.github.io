“Well, that makes sense. Poor fucker.”</p>
<p>They walked out through the back pasture, the dead grass silvered with frost. Then through the row of white pines, grown tight together so they had to push branches away from their faces, fingers sticky with pitch, up a small rise into the hardwood stand, impossible to walk quietly now, dead leaves crunching underfoot.</p>
<p>The blind was on top of the hill, a shallow dugout area around which August’s father had arranged logs and cut branches for concealment. They sat with their backs against sugar maples and watched the woods around them awaken with dawn. August’s father had only one gun. It was old, a Japanese 7.7 mm Arisaka with open sights, and a chrysanthemum stamped on the receiver. August’s grandfather, a marine, had brought it back with him from the South Pacific. He had died when August was young, and August had no memories of him. As the day gained strength around them, August watched his father’s eyes droop, then close completely. He had the gun cradled in his lap and gave a small, halting snore. August’s father had never been a marine. For most of Vietnam, he was just slightly too young, and then when he turned eighteen his number had never been called. August looked at him now and was simultaneously glad and disappointed to not be the son of a soldier.</p>
<p>August was starting to doze off himself when the rustle of leaves brought him back. He moved his head slowly, trying to see where the noise was coming from. He thought it might be a squirrel running back to its acorn stash under an oak, but then his eyes registered a larger brown shape moving just within his periphery. He shifted slowly to get a better look and he saw it, a buck, no doubt the one his father had mentioned. It was a big-bodied animal, neck thick and swollen with the rut. A good set of antlers, heavy and brown at the base, gleaming ivory at the tips, polished from rubbing on trees and sparring with other males. August reached his leg out and prodded his father with his boot. His father’s eyes opened quickly and August nodded to his left. The deer was sixty yards away, moving steadily, its head down, probably following the scent of doe in estrus. They watched the deer coming, disappearing and reappearing between the trunks of beech and oak and maple. His father was whispering something that August couldn’t make out, so he leaned closer. It sounded a lot like “I forgot to load the gun.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“The box of cartridges on the table at home. No bullets. Gun empty.” He shrugged.</p>
<p>August was stiff from sitting on the cold ground. He reached for the gun and then stood, lining up the iron sights, the buck slowing as it sensed something was not right. “Bang,” August said. And then the buck bounded away, the white flag of its tail receding through the brush. His father laughed and reached out his hand, and August helped him to his feet. He stretched and shook his legs out. “My fault,” he said. “Rookie move.”</p>
<p>“Nah, it’s fine. Easier this way. Probably I’d have missed anyway.”</p>
<p>“I guess now we’ll never know. Hell of a nice deer, though. What do you say? Brunch?”</p>
<p>When they got back they kicked off their boots and hung up their jackets in the entryway. Lisa was in the kitchen, her blond hair pulled back into a tight ponytail. She wore a Detroit Lions sweatshirt and men’s Carhartt pants. She gave August a hug. She smelled like flour and cinnamon, and also of the barn.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see you, August. Do you like eggs Benedict?” she said.</p>
<p>August settled into a chair. The TV was on, NFL pregame. In several hours the Lions would start the inevitable process of losing to the Bears. It was Thanksgiving. “Sure,” he said. “I like eggs Benedict just fine.”

<h3 id="crews-work-overnight-to-extinguish-fire-at-rsw">Crews work overnight to extinguish fire at RSW</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.winknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/FIRE51.jpg" alt="img">
Crews work overnight to extinguish fire at RSW</p>
<p>All Lee County fire departments responded to the scene of a brush fire that covered 15 acres and involved at least 100 cars in the rental car overflow area at Southwest Florida International Airport Friday.</p>
<p>The Florida Forest Service confirmed 100% of the fire was contained Saturday. Firefighters remained on scene through Friday to complete containment and remain monitoring the area. The Lee County Port Authority confirmed more than 3,500 cars were involved.</p>
<p>SEE UPDATE: Fire at RSW destroys over 3,500 rental cars, port authority says</p>
<p>Terminal Access Road is closed for people going to and from the airport. Officials asked people to park at the 7-Eleven and walk to long-term parking where a shuttle would take travelers to the terminal.</p>
<p>RSW also said it was using the employee airport parking lot for travelers and giving bus rides to all travelers so they didn’t miss their flights.</p>
<p>Officials said there were no people in the cars, and the cause of the brush fire is unknown at this time. But investigators believe it’s likely something related to the cars.</p>
<p>There were helicopter units that responded to the fire. The Florida Forest Service was also on scene and confirmed 100 cars were involved in the fire.</p>
<p>Fire departments from Collier and Charlotte counties also responded to the large-scale fire.</p>
<p>The fire was visible for miles Friday, and many viewers shared images and video clips from their vantage point of the flames.</p>
<p>“In San Carlos, I saw it from my window,” Jordan Battles said.</p>
<p>“I live in Bonita, so I saw it from Bonita,” Ethan Ortiz said. “Like, I saw the smoke all the way from Bonita.”</p>
<p>Another image below shows smoke from the brush and car fires at RSW airport seen from miles away near Cape Coral Hospital.</p>
