Podcast host says former vice-president, 77, is too old despite having endorsed Sanders, 78, for the Democratic nomination</p>
<p>Joe Rogan would &lsquo;rather vote for Trump than Biden&rsquo; after endorsing Sanders</p>
<p>The podcast host Joe Rogan has said he will vote for Donald Trump over Joe Biden in the presidential election, should the former vice-president be the Democratic nominee.</p>
<p>The US presidential election is frozen in time – can it survive? Read more</p>
<p>The comic was speaking on Friday’s edition of his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, which regularly tops the iTunes chart for downloads. Rogan has nearly 6m Twitter followers, regularly appears on television as a commentator on mixed martial arts, and is seen as an influential voice with young and blue-collar male voters.</p>
<p>During a conversation with guest Eric Weinstein, managing director of Thiel Capital, talk turned to the election. Weinstein, who works for the Trump-supporting tech mogul Peter Thiel, said he would not vote for Trump or Biden, the probable challenger in November.</p>
<p>Rogan, who has endorsed Bernie Sanders, said the party had made “morons” out of voters by appearing to favour Biden.</p>
<p>“I’d rather vote for Trump than [Biden],” said Rogan. “I don’t think [Biden] can handle anything. You’re relying entirely on his cabinet. If you want to talk about an individual leader who can communicate, he can’t do that. And we don’t know what the fuck he’ll be like after a year in office.</p>
<p>“The pressure of being president of the United States is something that no one has ever prepared for. The only one who seems to be fine with it is Trump, oddly enough.”</p>
<p>The president is 73 but Rogan said: “He doesn’t seem to be aging at all or in any sort of decline. Obama, almost immediately, started looking older. George W [Bush], almost immediately, started looking older.”</p>
<p>Biden will be 78 in November. Describing the former US senator as “very old”, Rogan said Biden’s famous verbal slip-ups were “not a normal way to communicate unless he’s high”.</p>
<p>Sanders, who took an early lead in the delegate race before losing a string of contests to Biden, is a year older than the former VP.</p>
<p>Sanders has “been insanely consistent his entire life”, Rogan said in January, unveiling his endorsement of the independent Vermont senator, a self-described democratic socialist.</p>
<p>“He’s basically been saying the same thing, been for the same thing for his whole life. And that in and of itself is a very powerful structure to operate from.”</p>
<p>Why the Joe Rogan endorsement is a good thing for Bernie Sanders | Bhaskar Sunkara Read more</p>
<p>Rogan has made many controversial statements. In January the president of the Human Rights Campaign said then Sanders should reconsider accepting Rogan’s endorsement, because the podcaster had “attacked transgender people, gay men, women, people of colour and countless marginalised groups at every opportunity”.</p>
<p>A Sanders spokeswoman said: “Sharing a big tent requires including those who do not share every one of our beliefs, while always making clear that we will never compromise our values.”</p>
<p>Writing for the Guardian, Jacobin magazine editor Bhaskar Sunkara said the Rogan endorsement was “the best endorsement Bernie Sanders could hope for”, as Rogan’s “fans are a group of people we can’t afford to cede to Trump”.

Joe Rogan may be best known for being the face and voice of the UFC, but that wasn’t his only gig.</p>
<p>Throughout his long entertainment career, Rogan’s done many jobs ranging from being a TV host to even a short-lived amateur career in kickboxing. And now, Rogan is making millions doing what he loves.</p>
<p>How Joe Rogan got to where he is today</p>
<p>Joe Rogan | Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images</p>
<p>After Rogan decided that a career in kickboxing wasn’t meant for him, he soon decided to pursue showbiz. Rogan got his start in stand up comedy, and soon, his jokes and charisma landed him some gigs in Hollywood. They weren’t really major gigs, but it still got his face out there.</p>
<p>All the meanwhile, Rogan was still interested in combat sports. He had quit kickboxing, but he never stopped training. In fact, after watching the very first UFC event, he became interested in all the different martial arts that were on display. He became such a big fan of the UFC that he started doing interviews for the UFC. But, this job didn’t pay well, and so, he quit.</p>
<p>It was around this time that Rogan got his gig as the host of Fear Factor. This was a popular show on network TV that really boosted Rogan’s popularity. But still, he loved watching the UFC.</p>
<p>Not long after he had quit working for the UFC, Dana White, the new president of the UFC, offered him free tickets if he would do commentary for the UFC. Rogan hasn’t stopped working for the UFC since.</p>
<p>A millionaire comedian</p>
<p>While Rogan was making good money doing comedy, hosting Fear Factor, as well as doing commentary for the UFC, another big source of income came when he started combining all of his skills for his podcast, the Joe Rogan Experience.</p>
<p>Not only was he hosting that podcast, but he was using his comedy chops as well as his UFC knowledge to create a great podcast experience for listeners.</p>
<p>The result is not only a boom in Rogan’s popularity, as the Joe Rogan Experience is one of the most popular podcasts in the air, but also a boom in his bank account. Rogan is now estimated to be worth $30 million, not due to any single one business decision, but due to all of them. His podcast has certainly made him a lot of money, but so has everything else.</p>
<p>With that much money, Rogan has been free to live his dream. He talks to his friends on the podcast for a relatively easy paycheck and he recently got a Netflix comedy special. This new wealth also means he’s been free to splurge and buy a lot of cars.</p>
<p>Joe Rogan’s car collection</p>
<p>Like any wealthy celebrity, Rogan has a sizable car collection, according to Hot Cars. In fact, Hot Cars says that after Elon Musk appeared as a guest on Rogan’s podcast, Rogan went ahead and bought himself a Tesla. That’s on top of the other cars that he has in his collection, which range from the usual cars to the stuff you’d expect to find in a celebrity’s garage.</p>
<p>For example, Hot Cars says that Rogan collects muscle cars such as classic Mustangs and Corvettes. Rogan also has sports cars that you’d expect the rich and famous to drive, such as a Porsche 911. But, Rogan’s a practical man, and he has cars that prioritize comfort and practicality over everything else.</p>
<p>That’s why Hot Cars says that Rogan owns an SUV when he wants to take his family out. He also has a fancy Mercedes-Benz that comes with a hot stone massage feature in its front seats. Such a luxury is a necessity for Rogan who travels on the road a lot.

<h3 id="joe-rogan-doctor-told-ufc-yoel-romero-is-the-most-unusual-human-being-ive-ever-seen">Joe Rogan: Doctor told UFC: Yoel Romero is the “most unusual human being I’ve ever seen”</h3>
<p><img src="https://thebodylockmma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Yoel-ROmero.jpg" alt="img">
It’s no secret that multi-time UFC middleweight title challenger Yoel Romero is a physical freak of nature, but on a recent episode of the Joe Rogan Experience, the promotion’s chief color commentator and the podcast’s namesake went as far as to say that Romero’s super-human status has been medically confirmed.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Speaking with fellow comedian Tom Segura on the podcast’s 1,447th episode on Wednesday, Rogan brought up a story about the 43-year-old Cuban Olympic wrestling standout after he and Segura briefly discussed the blockbuster Netflix documentary Icarus, which revealed a massive doping scandal involving Russian Olympians.</p>
<p>“Well, did you hear me talking about Yoel Romero?” Rogan began. “[UFC President] Dana White gave me this information.”</p>
<p>According to Rogan, the UFC brought Romero to an optometrist following one of his recent bouts with the promotion to have his orbital area examined.</p>
<p>“They brought in Yoel Romero because he had a fractured orbital in one of his fights,” said Rogan, “and, they bring him in, and he gets examined by this doctor, and the doctor calls the UFC up afterwards (sic) and says, ‘Where did you get this guy?'”</p>
<p>To which individuals within the UFC, Rogan says, responded, “‘What do you mean?'”</p>
<p>“‘I’ve never seen anyone like him,'” the doctor reportedly retorted. “‘Oh, yeah, he’s an amazing athlete,'” replied the UFC officials.</p>
<p>“‘No, no, no. I’ve never seen a human being like this,'” Rogan says the doctor revealed. “‘This is the most unusual human being I’ve ever seen in my 40 years of practicing medicine.'”</p>
<p>Rogan said, “[The doctor] said [Romero’s] tendons in his eyes are four times larger than a normal person’s. He goes, ‘His physical structure is different than any human being I’ve ever seen in my life.'”</p>
<p>Rogan and a stunned Segura shared a “Woah,” and Rogan continued.</p>
<p>“Cuba. Who knows what kind of wacky experiments they were doing,” Rogan said, purportedly of the Cuban government and its sporting teams.</p>
<p>“Russian pills when he was a kid, that’s for sure,” said Segura.</p>
<p>“Yeah, imagine, right? Imagine,” agreed Rogan. “I mean, he was a top-of-the-food-chain wrestler. He medalled in, literally, every single international wrestling meet he ever competed in. Yoel Romero is a super stud; just a super stud” Rogan concluded.</p>
<p>The pair then briefly discussed Romero’s most recent outing, a lackluster title loss to undefeated UFC middleweight champion Israel Adesanya.</p>
<p>“That was a weird fight, though, right? The last one with Izzy?” asked Segura.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. It wasn’t a good fight,” Rogan replied.</p>
<p>Romero (13-5) has competed in the UFC since his debut with the promotion in 2013 following a one-fight stint in the now-defunct Strikeforce FC.</p>
<p>In April of 2016, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), the anti-doping partner of the UFC, announced that Romero had tested positive for the banned substance Ibutamoren – a growth hormone secretagogue – following and out-of-competition test in December of 2015.</p>
<p>Romero provided USADA with access to the supplements he was taking at the time, one of which contained Ibutamoren despite not listing the banned substance on its label. As USADA wrote in their statement on Romero’s case, the “presence of an undisclosed prohibited substance in a product is regarded as contamination.”</p>
<p>As a result, Romero was found to have unknowingly ingested the supplement, received a “reduced sanction,” and did not suffer the disqualification of his “competitive results” from December 12’s UFC 194 – the event preceding the test – where he had earned a split-decision victory over Ronaldo “Jacaré” Souza.</p>
<p>Romero sued the supplement-maker responsible for the contaminated supplement, triumphing in court in May of 2019.</p>
<p>The judgment in the case was for Romero to be paid a whopping $27.45 million ($3 million for lost wages, reputable harm, and emotional damages, respectively, all of which were tripled due to New Jersey’s Consumer Fraud Act) from the supplement-maker, Gold Star Performance Products.</p>
<p>Following the verdict, Romero told ESPN, “I’m very happy… It’s not about the money. I’m very happy now that everything is clean and more clear. You cannot live very well when you hear and you see when you post something [on social media] people reply ‘Soldier of Steroids.’ You cannot sleep very well. … It’s very emotional and important, too, because I know I’ve never taken anything in my life.”</p>
<p>His manager, Abe Kawa, told ESPN, “I’m absolutely happy, even if zero dollars are collected, that the world knows this man was not a cheater.”
