<p>When buying offshore real estate, your choice of city is perhaps even more important than picking a country.</p>

<p>Real estate markets are driven by local factors like employment opportunities and housing supply. Because of that, a nation’s broader economic data usually isn’t relevant to property market performance in one of its cities.</p>

<p>For example, if you purchased a luxury condo in Bangkok’s central core five years ago, your asset would have doubled in value.</p>

<p>If you bought in Pattaya instead, you would now be facing a buyer’s market due to oversupply problems and weak tourist numbers.</p>

<p>And neither of those results correlates with Thai GDP growth or some other general economic indicator.</p>

<p>Returns will depend on the specific location you’re buying in. Of course, that doesn’t mean choosing a country isn’t important as well.</p>

<p>Buying real estate in Malaysia will give you a ten-year renewable residence permit along with several additional perks. Likewise, foreigners can legally own land in places such as Japan and South Korea.</p>

<p>Laws are determined at the national level while potential for profit relies on the precise city or neighborhood.</p>

<p>We’re more interested in returns than residency here at InvestAsian. Granted, some investors enjoy the idea of owning land abroad. Or may want permission to actually spend time in a city they’re buying property in.</p>

<p>Keeping all that in mind, here are the five best cities in Asia to buy real estate. They’re judged based on appreciation prospects, demographics, rental yields, and variety of options available to foreign investors.</p>

<h2 id="bangkok">Bangkok</h2>

<p>Bangkok is one of the world’s most visited cities, outranking favorites like London and Paris in terms of annual tourist numbers.</p>

<p>Thirty-five million foreigners visit the “Land of Smiles” each year. Naturally, this means Thailand is often people’s first experience with emerging Asia.</p>

<p>It’s probably no coincidence that surging Chinese tourist arrivals occurred at roughly the same time as rising condo prices and transaction volume in central Bangkok. The city quickly turned into Asia’s top destination for Chinese property buyers abroad.</p>

<p>Thus, Bangkok’s property market is perhaps your most liquid choice in Southeast Asia because of its plethora of realtors and fresh flow of foreign buyers.</p>

<p>Remember also: you aren’t just investing in a house or condo unit when buying offshore real estate. You hold a stake in the currency your asset is denominated in too.</p>

<p>As such, it’s worth mentioning that Thailand’s Baht is among Asia’s best currencies lately. The baht has recently outperformed currencies frequently used as a storage as wealth such as the Singapore Dollar.</p>

<h2 id="kuala-lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</h2>

<p>Kuala Lumpur, while overlooked in favor of Bangkok, arguably has the region’s most open and competitively priced real estate market.</p>

<p>In fact, foreigners are allowed to own freehold houses in Malaysia, making it Southeast Asia’s only country where non-locals can legally buy land under their own name.</p>

<p>Foreign property owners can even get a long-term visa through the Malaysia My Second Home (MM2H) program.</p>

<p>Malaysia is ASEAN’s third richest nation right after Singapore and Brunei. Therefore, you might guess that property in Kuala Lumpur is more expensive than elsewhere on this list.</p>

<p>You can buy a luxury condo right in the center of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for around US$4,000 per square meter though – less expensive than Bangkok and about the same price as Manila.</p>

<p>These factors make Kuala Lumpur one of the best cities in Asia for real estate. It’s certainly one of your most versatile choices. Malaysia’s lack of foreign ownership restrictions, good value for money, and having residence included is a full package.</p>

<h2 id="phnom-penh">Phnom Penh</h2>

<p>Cambodia’s capital is among Southeast Asia’s fastest growing cities. Due to strong urbanization and a healthy birth rate, Phnom Penh’s current population of two million will double by 2030.</p>

<p>A steadily increasing population, along with Cambodia’s rising middle class and other growth drivers, equals greater demand for central real estate in the long-term.</p>

<p>Phnom Penh’s finance district hosts more than a dozen global banks such as ICBC, Bank of China, and ANZ. Meanwhile, AEON Group from Japan recently built two huge malls out in the suburbs with each of them achieving 100% occupancy and several thousand visitors per day.</p>

<p>The city is an emerging tourist hub as well. Phnom Penh International Airport reached more than 5 million inward arrivals in 2018, up from 1.7 million just a decade earlier.</p>

<p>But despite obvious potential for appreciation and yields, prime real estate in Phnom Penh still costs below US$1,000 per square meter in many cases. Property values in nearby capital cities like Jakarta and Hanoi are beyond US$4,000 per square meter in comparison.</p>

<h2 id="manila">Manila</h2>

<p>Manila is already one of the biggest cities on the entire planet with over 24 million people living in its metro area.</p>

<p>And it will only get larger. Manila is expected to have at least 35 million inhabitants by the year 2050 which should rank the Philippine metropolis above even Tokyo and Beijing.</p>

<p>Similarly, the population of the Philippines itself will increase from 105 million to 150 million by 2050. This immense population boom will almost inevitably lead to higher real estate prices in the long term.</p>

<p>Manila’s prospects are comparable to other cities on our list such as Kuala Lumpur and Phnom Penh. Yet a difference between Manila and its rivals is the city’s sheer size – both currently and regarding its future potential.</p>

<p>Kuala Lumpur and Phnom Penh, while undergoing rapid transformation themselves, probably won’t become megacities or top global business centers anytime soon.</p>

<p>Manila has the necessary weight to become a “Tokyo of the 21st Century” as implausible as it may seem now.</p>

<p>A negative aspect of buying Manila property is lack of options available to foreigners though. You can own freehold condominum units in the Philippines as a non-local but aren’t allowed to purchase houses or land.</p>

<h2 id="seoul">Seoul</h2>

<p>The sole East Asian city on this list, Seoul boasts solid demographics and foreign-buyer friendly laws in stark contrast to China and Japan.</p>

<p>In fact, along with Kuala Lumpur, Seoul is one of very few capital cities in Asia where foreigners can own land and houses on a freehold basis. You won’t encounter any limitations as a foreign buyer in South Korea.</p>

<p>Seoul is also the only developed city on our list. You will not get outsized returns here like you would in Manila or even Kuala Lumpur. Of course, it’s a trade-off in exchange for stability.</p>

<p>With that said, Seoul enjoys far superior prospects compared to nearby Tokyo which will suffer from population decline throughout the 21st century. Korea’s population will not age anytime soon, and in general, its economy is stronger than Japan’s.</p>

<p>Are you seeking yields or wealth preservation? If the latter, real estate in Seoul is a good blend of growth and safety.</p>

<p>Yield-seeking investors should consider buying property in Asia’s frontier markets instead.</p>

<h1 id="big-data-monetization-lessons-from-zillow">BIG DATA MONETIZATION LESSONS FROM ZILLOW</h1>

<p>The real estate industry has gone through a massive transformation as new real estate websites such as Zillow (and Trulia now owned by Zillow, and Redfin) have brought together Big Data sets on available properties, home buyers, and home sellers. These firms have, in the process, showed us that important lessons and best practices in monetizing Big Data.</p>

<p>While Zillow set out to disrupt the real estate market, its existence coincided with a growth in both fees paid to agents and an increase in the use of agents. In effect, Zillow transformed into a different kind of middleman – a data broker. Zillow and its competitors, Trulia and Redfin, through their data exchanges, have brought transparency to the real estate market. Because of these firms, due diligence, thorough searching, and even neighborhood comparisons are now easily available online. Zillow and its competitors brought convenience through its data products and have monetized them. Some may argue that their success, Zillow’s especially, may be more a function of the timing during which they launched: the housing market had just crashed and banks were selling homes. Suddenly, information on the direction of the housing market, neighborhoods, and foreclosures was worth a premium. Zillow fused various forms of data and embraced the realtor as a major part of its revenue source and developed data products to serve the realtor as part of their data monetization strategy.</p>

<p>The success of Zillow offers some important lessons in growing and managing data exchanges. Their success in creating data, analyzing data, and leveraging that data in novel ways offers lessons for all firms:</p>

<p>Develop a Data Exchange with Customers on the Platform of your Customer’s Preference
Data exchanges have become increasingly important in many markets. Many exchanges like eBay and Amazon are now accessible on mobile platforms. Customers have shown a strong preference for data exchange use on mobile platforms. Leverage the movement to mobile apps to provide vicinity information. Increase customer participation on mobile apps by refreshing data at a high rate, making frequent consumer visits worthwhile and valuable.</p>

<p>Fuse Data from Many Sources and Formats
Relevant data comes from many sources and formats. Fusing data from public sources with proprietary data improves convenience for consumers and creates a economic benefit in that multiple sites do not need to be accessed. It promotes scale in the number of consumers and achieves increased precision in data too. Data is also not just numeric. Develop platforms that take in text, photos, video, and even audio. Develop rankings and indices that can help organize non-numeric data. Tagging and descriptions of non-numerical data are necessary to finding and accessing such data.</p>

<p>Bring Scale to Data with Indices
Having lots of data requires understanding the rank, severity, or importance of any specific entity. Indices help bring scale and communicate these natural inquiries. Just as a temperature scale allows us to understand severity and make relative comparisons, develop indices that allow users of your data to do the same. The above graphic in this post is a heat map of the “Walk Score” for various neighborhoods in Los Angeles. The index of walkability was one created by Zillow and offers consumers a great comparison of neighborhoods.</p>

<p>Solve Customer Needs with Data Products
In general, customers do not want data. Customers have market questions. They seek answers to those questions. It is absolutely important that data products be created to solve the problems facing customers and answer the questions that they have. The data products permit monetization and marketplaces.</p>

<p>Achieve Market Scale Quickly
Although the real estate market has given rise to multiple sophisticated data exchanges (Zillow, Trulia, and Redfin), Zillow emerged as a leader quite quickly. This was possible because it achieved scale quickly. It included more properties before the other sites. The marketplace rewards firms that achieve scale first. With more data, more innovation and more data products are possible. With that comes more users, and with more users comes more opportunities for monetization.</p>

<p>Treat and View Your Data as an Asset
Zillow has a great reverence for its data. In its annual report to investors, it even describes the types of data it collects and its plans to collect more. Few firms are predicated on data as an asset, but that is changing. If you want your firm to view your data as an asset, you must begin to treat it that way. If data is the future of your firm, map your data strategy to your business strategy. It brings focus to the importance of data by your employees and by investors who see a future in your data monetization plans.</p>

<p>Focus Data Products on Sellers: Reminder that Sellers (and Their Agents) are More Willing to Pay Than Buyers
Zillow shows us that in its quest to unleash information about homes to buyers, it remains that the sellers and the listing agents (real estate agents of sellers) are most economically incentivized to pay for data products. A large portion of Zillow’s revenue comes from listing agents, just like eBay earns from sellers, Google earns from advertisers (and not buyer) and the list goes on and on. Examine your business model for the role of buyers and their agents. Focus data products on sellers. Develop premium data products for sellers versus buyers.</p>

<p>These important implications of Big Data use  are developed in greater detail in my recent book, From Big Data to Big Profits: Success with Data and Analytics. The book examines the evolving nature of Big Data and how businesses can leverage it to create new monetization opportunities. Using case studies on Apple, Netflix, Google, LinkedIn, Zillow, Amazon, and other leading-edge users of Big Data, the book also explores how digital platforms, including mobile apps and social networks, are changing customer interactions and expectations, as well as the way Big Data is created and managed by companies. Companies looking to develop a Big Data strategy will find great value in the SIGMA framework, which assesses companies for Big Data readiness and provides direction on the steps necessary to get the most from Big Data.</p>
