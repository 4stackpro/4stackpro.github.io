<p>About Your Itinerary Planning
      Therefore, there are some points you should know before reading the following introduction about the airport transportation. From some traveling forums, there are always questions asking the wrong or indirect questions.  Some foreigner visitors may choose to take HSR to Fenjia night market. However, the transportation becomes: Taoyuan Airport(Metro)-&gt; HSR Taiyuan(HSR)-&gt;HSR Taichung-&gt;(Bus 160)Fenjia Night Market.

Your itinerary affects the public transportation information you need when you arrive the airport.</p>

<pre><code>    Lots visits arrange their daily itinerary independent. For examples, some foreigner visitors arrive the airport in the afternoon and they plan to  go to Hualien in the evening. However, it may be not doable. Going to Taipei first and have a day trip to Taroko from Taipei would be a better alternative.
</code></pre>

<p>Your final destiny matters</p>

<pre><code>    A lots questions are not specific. For example, some ask how to go to Taichung but they don't mention that their destiny is Fenjia Night Market. The public transportation methods to Taichung may different. The fastest public transportation to Taichung may be HSR, but the fastest public transportation to Fenjia Night Market maybe shuttle bus since you don't need to transfer and the bus stop is closer to Fenjia Night Market than HSR station. Therefore, make sure your destiny. Asking a destiny other than your final destiny may put your itinerary in risk.

    Another misunderstanding is that train stations and HSR stations may be at the same station or may be ad different stations. Taipei Train Station and HSR Taipei Station are in Taipei Main Station, but Taichung Train Station and HSR Station are not in the same station.
    Be aware of the stations. Train stations and HSR stations may be at the same station or may be ad different stations.
</code></pre>

p.s.The last bus of Kuo-Kuang Bus 1860 to Taichung is 1:50am (a extra run 2:30am in Sat.)</p>

<pre><code>    The midnight transportation is much difficult. Only Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung is reachable in the midnight. You can also go to Taipei or Taichung and then transfer to other cities, e.g. Tainan, Chiayi, since the bus between major cities are 24h. However, the transfer hour will make you exhausted in the midnight.
    There are more and more budget flights to Taiwan. Lots budget flight arrive Taoyuan Airport in the midnight (0 am~6 am). You may stay at the airport until sunrise. However, you could also take 24H bus to Taipei or Taichung directly. The following timetable is for bus schedule between 00:00~06:00. All the bus line will go to T1 or T2. It takes about 5 minutes between T1 &amp; T2. If the bus launch from T2 at 01:00, then you can estimate that the bus will arrive T2 around 01:05.

<p>Taichung (Caoma, Taichung Station): Kou-Kuang Bus 1860 :
Launch From T1: 00:10, 01:10, 01:50</p>

<pre><code>    Since Taoyuan Airport is closed to freeway and there are 24H bus running between Taipei, Taichung, Chiayi, Tainan and Kaohsiung on the freeway, you can take go to Zhongli Service Area first and take other bus to your destiny. From some feedback, the tickets of bus 1819 to Taipei maybe sold out. If you don't want to take taxi and you don't want to take 1819, you can take 1627 first and then transfer to Taipei.
