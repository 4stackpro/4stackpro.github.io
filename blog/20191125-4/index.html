<p>It’s important to understand the home buying process so I’ve created a 7-step checklist.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-down-payment">Step 1: Down Payment</h2>

<p>The hardest part to buying a home is saving the down payment (a gift from the Bank of Mom &amp; Dad also works).</p>

<p>For purchases under $500K, minimum down payment is 5%.
Buying between $501-999K you need 5% on first $500K PLUS 10% down payment for anything over $500K.
Buying a home over $1M you need 20% down payment.
BLOG 5 GREAT Reasons To Provide a 20% Down Payment when Buying a Home</p>

<p>For any home purchases with less than 20% down payment, you are also required to purchase Mortgage Default Insurance.  BLOG Everything You Wanted to Know about Mortgage Default Insurance</p>

<h2 id="step-2-strategize-define-your-budget-and-get-pre-qualified">Step 2: Strategize, Define Your Budget and get Pre-Qualified</h2>

<p>Unless you can afford to buy a home, cash in hand, you are going to need a mortgage.</p>

<p>You need to get pre-qualified, which should not be confused with the term pre-approved.</p>

<p>The big difference is that no approval is ever given by a lender until they have an opportunity to examine the property that you wish to purchase.  The bank may love you… but they also must love the property you want to buy.</p>

<p>Pre-qualifying will focus on gathering documentation to prove the information on your mortgage application including credit, debt load, income/employment, down payment etc.</p>

<p>BLOG Pre-Approved for Your Mortgage…  What Does that Really Mean???</p>

<p>Mortgage brokers will make sure you get a great mortgage rate.  Just as important as rates are the terms of your mortgage which should include:</p>

<p>prepayment options (10-20%)
penalties BLOG Mortgage Penalties – Ouch… How Much??
portability
We also discuss what type of mortgage fits your current situation</p>

<p>fixed vs variable?
life of the mortgage (amortization) 25 or 30 years etc.
payments – monthly, semi monthly, accelerated bi-weekly</p>

<h2 id="step-3-set-your-budget">Step 3: Set Your Budget</h2>

<p>Keep in mind that just because you’re pre-qualified for a certain amount of mortgage, doesn’t mean you can actually afford that amount. Prepare your own monthly budget to be sure.</p>

<p>Typically, your total home payments (including mortgage, property taxes, strata fees &amp; heat) should not exceed 32-39% of your gross (pre-tax) income.</p>

<h2 id="step-4-find-the-right-property-time-to-engage-a-realtor">Step 4:  Find the Right Property – Time to Engage a Realtor</h2>

<p>Once you have been prequalified for a mortgage, based on your budget… you need to find a realtor.</p>

<p>Selecting the right real estate agent is a very important step in the home buying process.  When you work with an agent, you can expect them to help you with many things, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Finding a home</li>
<li>Scheduling tours of homes</li>
<li>Researching the market, neighbourhood and home itself</li>
<li>Making and negotiating your offer to purchase, and counter-offers</li>
<li>Providing expert advice on home buying</li>
<li>Handling the offer, gathering documentation and closing paperwork</li>
</ul>

<p>I recommend interviewing at least 3 realtors.  You will quickly decide who has your best interests in mind.  Do you want to deal directly with a realtor who’s going to work with directly when you go home hunting, or do you want to deal with a BIG name realtor, who has buyers &amp; sellers realtors working under them?  There are advantages to each – you need to decide what is the best fit for your situation.</p>

<p>Get referrals for realtors from friends and family… OR ask me, I have a group of realtors that I know and trust.</p>

<h2 id="step-5-mortgage-approval">Step 5:  Mortgage Approval</h2>

<p>Once you have found the property you would like to call home, your mortgage broker will send your mortgage application and property information to the lender who is the best fit for your situation, based on your input.</p>

<p>If the lender likes your financial situation and the property, they will issue a “commitment” letter outlining the terms of the mortgage.  The lender will send you a list of documents, so they can verify and validate all the information you told them on the mortgage application.</p>

<h2 id="step-6-time-for-the-solicitor-lawyer-or-notary">Step 6:  Time for the Solicitor (Lawyer or Notary)</h2>

<p>Once the lender has reviewed and approved all your mortgage documentation and the property documentation, your file will be sent to your solicitor (in BC you can use a lawyer or notary).  They will process all the necessary title changes and set up a time for you to meet, review mortgage documents and sign.</p>

<h2 id="step-7-get-the-keys">Step 7:  Get the Keys</h2>

<p>On the closing day the documentation for your home purchase will be filed at the land titles office by your solicitor.  Typically, the possession date is 1 or 2 days later, giving time for the money (down payment &amp; mortgage) to get to the home seller.  On possession day you set up a time to meet with your realtor to get the keys.</p>

<p>Congratulations you’re done – you now own your home!!</p>

<p>Mortgages are complicated, but they don’t have to be… Engage an expert!</p>

<h1 id="best-affiliate-marketing-programs-of-2019">Best affiliate marketing programs of 2019</h1>

<p>Affiliate marketing is the key to generating income from websites that might otherwise struggle to sell advertising space, or else service as an additional revenue stream for those websites already active in the advertising space.</p>

<!--adsense-->

<p>The concept of affiliate marketing is relatively simple: you sign up for a program for a particular product or service, and if accepted for it, you can then using existing marketing materials and/or links with a unique URL. In the event that someone signs up for that product or service using that URL, you earn a commission.</p>
