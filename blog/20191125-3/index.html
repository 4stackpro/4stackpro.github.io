<p>Buying a home is one of the most important financial decisions you will make.</p>

<p>It’s common for a first-time home buyer to be overwhelmed when it comes to real estate industry jargon, so this BLOG is to help make some of the jargon understandable.</p>

<p>To help you understand the process and have confidence in your choices, check out the following common terms you will encounter during the home buying process.</p>

<ul>
<li>Amortization – “Life of the mortgage” The process of paying off a debt by making regular installment payments over a set period of time, at the end of which the loan balance is zero.  Typical amortizations are 25 years or if you have over 20% down payment – 30 years.</li>
<li>Appraisal – An estimate of the current market value of a home.  A property is appraised to know the amount of money that a lender is willing to lend for a buyer to buy a particular property. If the appraised amount is less than the asking price for the property, then that piece of real estate might be overpriced. In this case, the lender will refuse to finance the purchase.  Appraisals are designed to protect both the lender and buyer. The lender will not get stuck with a property that is less than the money lent, and the buyer will avoid paying too much for the property.</li>
<li>Closing Costs – Costs you need to have available in addition to the purchase price of your home. Closing costs can include: legal fees, taxes (GST, HST, Property Transfer Tax (PTT) etc.),  transfer fees, disbursements and are payable on closing day. They can range from 1.5% to 4% of a home’s selling price.  Don’t Forget the Closing Costs When You Purchase a Home</li>
<li>Co-Signer – A person that signs a credit application with another person, agreeing to be equally responsible for the repayment of the loan.  Would a Co-Signer Enable You to Qualify for a Mortgage?</li>
<li>Down Payment – The portion of the home price that is NOT financed by the mortgage loan. The buying typically pays the down payment from their own resources (or other eligible sources) to secure a mortgage.  5 GREAT Reasons To Provide a 20% Down Payment when Buying a Home</li>
<li>Equity – The difference between the price a home could be sold for and the total debts registered against it (i.e. mortgage). Equity usually increases as the mortgage is reduced by regular payments. Rising home prices and home improvements may also increase the equity in the property.</li>
<li>Fixed Interest Rate – a fixed mortgage interest rate is locked-in and will not increase for the term of the mortgage. Fixed vs. Variable Rate Mortgages – Pros &amp; Cons</li>
<li>Gross Debt Service Ratio (GDS) and Total Debt Service Ratio (TDS)</li>
<li>GDS – Typically mortgage lenders only want you spending a maximum 35-39% of your gross income on your mortgage (principle &amp; interest), property taxes, heat and 50% of your strata fees.</li>
<li>TDS – typically, lenders want you spending a maximum 39-44% of your gross income on your GDS – PLUS any other debt obligations you have (credit card debt, car payments, lines of credit &amp; loans). 3 “Rules of Lending” what Banks look at when you apply for a Mortgage in Canada</li>
<li>High-ratio mortgage / Conventional Mortgage – a high ratio mortgage is a mortgage loan higher than 80% of the lending value of the home. A conventional mortgage is when you have more than 20% down payment. In Canada, if you put less than 20% down payment, you must have Mortgage Default Insurance (see below) and your mortgage affordability (GDS &amp; TDS) is “stress tested” with the Bank of Canada’s qualifying rate (currently 4.64%).</li>
<li>Interest Rate – This is the monthly principal and interest payment rate.</li>
<li>Mortgage – A legal document that pledges property to a lender as security for the repayment of the loan. The term is also used to refer to the loan itself.</li>
<li>Mortgage Broker – A professional who works with many different lenders to find a mortgage that best suits the needs of the borrower.  What is the difference between a Mortgage Broker &amp; a Mortgage Specialist (hint – specialists work for the bank)!!</li>
<li>Mortgage Default Insurance – Is required for mortgage loans with less than a 20% down payment and is available from Canadian Mortgage &amp; Housing Corp. (CMHC) or 2 other private companies. This insurance protects the lender in case you are unable to fulfill your financial obligations regarding the mortgage.  Everything You Wanted to Know about Mortgage Default Insurance</li>
<li>Open / Closed Mortgage   An open mortgage is a flexible mortgage that allows you to pay off your mortgage in part or in full before the end of its term, because of the flexibility the interest rates are higher. Closed mortgages typically cannot be paid off in whole or in part before the end of its term. Some lenders allow for a partial prepayment of a closed mortgage by increasing the mortgage payment or a lump sum prepayment. If you try and “break your mortgage” or if any prepayments are made above the stipulated allowance the lender allows, a penalty will be charged. Mortgage Penalties – Ouch… How Much??</li>
<li>Pre-Approval – A lender commits to lend to a potential borrower a fixed loan amount based on a completed loan application, credit reports, debt, savings and has been reviewed by an underwriter. The commitment remains as long as the borrower still meets the qualification requirements at the time of purchase. This does not guaranty a loan until the property has passed inspections underwriting guidelines. Pre-Approved for Your Mortgage… What Does that Really Mean???</li>
<li>Refinance – Refinancing is the process of replacing an existing mortgage with a new one by paying off the existing debt with a new, loan under different terms.</li>
<li>Term (Mortgage) – Length of time that the contract with your mortgage including interest rate is fixed (typically 5 years)</li>
<li>Title – The documented evidence that a person or organization has legal ownership of real property.</li>
<li>Title Insurance – Insurance against losses or damages that could occur because of anything that affects the title to a property. Insurance Title insurance is issued by a Title Company to insure the borrower against errors in the title to your property.</li>
</ul>

<p>Variable Rate Mortgage or Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) A variable mortgage interest rate is based on the Bank of Canada rate and can fluctuate based on market conditions, the Canadian economy. A mortgage loan with an interest rate that is subject to change and is not fixed at the same level for the life of the loan. These types of loans usually start off with a lower interest rate but can subject the borrower to payment uncertainty. Fixed vs. Variable Rate Mortgages – Pros &amp; Cons</p>

<h1 id="lending-out-your-credit">Lending Out Your Credit</h1>

<p>This post is about protecting your credit. Not from fraud… From family and friends. I’ve never experienced this but I know people who have. These people were co-signers on a loan for family members who either didn’t pay on time or at all on the loan. The end result was damaged credit.</p>

<h2 id="children-and-vehicle-loans">Children and Vehicle Loans…</h2>

<p>Parents everywhere want to ensure their children have nice, dependable vehicles to drive. Oftentimes, this includes the parent signing or co-signing on auto loans. My mom and dad have done this for me and/or my brother. My dad was the first to sign away his credit. My brother was without a vehicle. He found a truck he wanted and didn’t have credit so he asked my dad to co-sign for it. My dad did it. Sometime down the road, my brother decided he didn’t want the truck but instead wanted a car one of his friends was selling. My dad ended up taking over the payments on the truck so his credit wasn’t damaged because my brother wasn’t making them. I believe he co-signed on the loan for the car also. My brother went into the Airforce and when he made it out to Arizona, he decided he needed another truck. He traded the car and found a truck. My dad co-signed for it. My brother got out of the Airforce and came home. Once he got home, he wasn’t employed and wasn’t paying the truck payments. The truck was repossessed, my dad’s credit was ruined, and my dad was angry. Fast forward a few years and my brother was without a vehicle again. He found a truck he wanted and because he’d already ruined my dad’s credit, he knew better than to ask my dad to co-sign. So he asked my mom for help. My brother’s credit was so bad that my mom co-signing wasn’t an option. She had to sign for the truck fully. It was in her name and only her name. Long story short, he made only a couple of payments and my mom made the rest to keep her credit in good standing. Rather than taking truck from my brother, she essentially bought him the truck.</p>

<p>Now when it came to buying a vehicle for me, my mom made me save up $1,000.00 before agreeing to go car shopping. I did and we went to the dealership and found my dream car, a 1998 two door, electric blue Dodge Neon with a spoiler on the back. Yep… I was 16 years old and that was what I wanted! My mom did the negotiating and the signing. I had no credit of my own so this was fully in her name. I paid every single payment without fail. I was very afraid of the thought of losing my car (because I LOVE LOVE LOVED that car) and of ruining my mom’s credit. I had already watched the turmoil that my dad had gone through with my brother and co-signing for his vehicles. Despite this car being in my mom’s name, I paid every cent on that loan. I appreciated that car and took great care of it.</p>

<h2 id="homes-and-utilities">Homes and Utilities…</h2>

<p>This section doesn’t have anything to do with vehicles or loans. This has to do with renting your home to someone else while you live elsewhere. My friend owns her own home. At one point, she met someone and decided to move in with him. This would leave her home vacant so she decided to rent it to her son. He was allowed to have two roommates and they’d share the rent. The roommates were to pay her son their portion of the rent and bills and her son would pay the mortgage and utilities. All of the utilities stayed in my friend’s name because it was easier that way. The relationship my friend was in ended and she moved back home. Weeks after moving back in, she started receiving notices in the mail regarding her mortgage. It was overdue. Her son was collecting the rent from his roommates but never paying the mortgage. She also received notices from the electric, water, and phone companies which were all overdue. Some of these notices were final notices. This had an impact on her credit and if she hadn’t have noticed it as soon as she did, she could have lost her home. She had call each company and pay these bills with a credit card to become current. The only solution that comes to mind here is she should have gone by the house to collect the rent money and the money for the bills each month rather than depending on her son to do it on her behalf.</p>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion…</h2>

<p>It’s natural to want to help your loved ones. Whether it’s co-signing on a vehicle loan or an apartment lease, you need to protect yourself when doing so. Ask all of the questions. How much is the loan/lease payment? This will let you know if you can pay for the loan yourself should they fall behind or fail to pay at all. Ask the loan company to contact you immediately should the person miss any payments. Ask for your own set of loan documents so you know the terms of the contract. Ask for a monthly budget from the person you’re co-signing for so you see that they can actually afford what you’re helping them get. Explore all options. Are there other options rather than co-signing for this? Co-signing comes with high risk so you want to make sure you ask all questions regarding this loan! If you have any comments or co-signing experiences, please leave a comment!!</p>
